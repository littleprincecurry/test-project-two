Bush. She added that the suit suffered from “a glaring lack of evidence tying the President’s alleged discriminatory intent to the specific TPS terminations.”  Callahan said it was not improper for White House officials to emphatically urge officials at DHS to terminate the TPS programs. “The mere fact that the White House exerted pressure on the Secretaries’ TPS decisions does not in itself support the conclusion that the President’s alleged racial animus was a motivating factor in the TPS decisions,” she wrote.  The court’s majority did, in passing, deliver what read like a rebuke to Trump, saying the judges “do not condone the offensive and disparaging nature of the President’s remarks.”  Nelson, an appointee of President Donald Trump, joined Callahan’s opinion, also wrote separately to stress that the court’s ruling should not be viewed as an endorsement of the Trump administration’s decisions regarding immigrants from the four countries.  “There is no question that these individuals deserve our sympathy. And they may well warrant legislative protection ... but that does not dictate the outcome of this case” Nelson wrote, before insisting that the court hadn’t actually passed judgment on Trump’s comments.  “I concur in the panel’s holding, which does not opine on the moral equities or the merits of President Trump’s political statements,” Nelson added.  Nelson’s concurring opinion also criticized the nationwide aspect of the San Francisco judge’s injunction and noted that Haitians would be unaffected by the court’s ruling Monday because of the New York judge’s parallel order, which was also nationwide in scope.  “If one out of 100 district court judges is willing to declare a statute, rule, or regulation invalid and enjoin its enforcement, the other nine—or even 99—at-bats before the judiciary have no effect,\" Nelson complained.  Judge Morgan Christen dissented from the decision, arguing that the plaintiffs made a strong case that then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acted arbitrarily by deciding that DHS would no longer take account of intervening events since immigrants’ home countries were designated for TPS protection.  Christen also said those challenging the government’s action presented ample evidence that Trump’s racial bias infected the decisions. She noted not only Trump’s \"shithole countries\" comment, but his claims that Haitians with TPS status “all have AIDS” and his descriptions of Mexican and Central American immigrants as criminals and snakes.  \"Remarkably, the government urges us to interpret the many denigrating comments in the record as descriptions of inferior living conditions in foreign countries, rather than evidence of racial animus,” Christen, an appointee of President Barack Obama, wrote. “But we cannot sweep aside the words that were actually used, and it would be worse for us to deny their meaning. Some of the statements expressly referred to people, not to places. The President’s statements require no deciphering.”  However, Christen said she would have ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction based on the legal infirmities in DHS’ change in policy for analyzing TPS, without ruling on the alleged racial bias.  The plaintiffs in the case, who are U.S.-citizen children of those covered by TPS, decried the ruling.  “This government has failed me and the other 250,000 U.S. citizen children of TPS holders,” said Crista Ramos, whose mother is from El Salvador and has TPS status. “If this decision stands, it means Trump’s termination of TPS will move ahead and TPS holders will only have until January 2021 to legally live and work in this country. We need our senators to act now and pass the Dream & Promise Act to grant TPS holders a permanent residency before another wave of family separations occurs.\"  A spokesperson for the Justice Department said officials are \"pleased\" with the 9th Circuit ruling. \"For approximately two years, the district court\\'s injunction prevented the Department of Homeland Security from taking action that Congress has vested solely within the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security — action that is statutorily precluded from judicial review. We applaud the Ninth Circuit\\'s recognition of the plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its rejection of the baseless accusations of animus behind the actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security,\" the spokesperson said.'}\n"

We applaud the Ninth Circuit\\'s recognition of the plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its rejection of the baseless accusations of animus behind the actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security,\" the spokesperson said.'}\n",

Sometimes I’m not sure what to do. But in those moments, I’m reminded education continues to be one of our most powerful tools to countering hate.”  Last week, Trump said he would sign an executive order to establish a \"1776 Commission,” a nod to the 1619 project, a New York Times Magazine production named after the year that the first slaves arrived in Virginia. The project has been adapted into a curriculum guide for schools to use, and focuses on the history of slavery as the root of systemic racism in the U.S.  Trump and other Republicans have tried to discredit the project and called similar teachings in schools a “twisted web of lies.” The president threatened to defund California schools that teach the 1619 Project in a tweet earlier this month.  Thurmond dismissed those threats on Monday, and supported the use of the 1619 Project in California schools. Trump does not have the power to mandate state school curriculum.  “I don’t know how else to say it, I thought that the president’s tweet was just ridiculous and reckless and irresponsible to in any way suggest that schools would somehow have their funding threatened for simply teaching the history and the facts that racism has existed in this country and that there are deep impacts from slavery,” he said.  The California Department of Education is also developing the nation’s first statewide ethnic studies curriculum model. A bill headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk would make that curriculum a graduation requirement for California high school students by the 2029-30 school year. Another bill signed by Newsom last month will require all undergraduate students in the California State University system to complete an ethnic studies course before graduation.  The new Education to End Hate initiative announced on Monday is designed to empower California’s more than 6 million K-12 students and teachers to “confront the hate, bigotry and racism rising in communities across the state and nation,” according to the state Department of Education.  The initiative will include a virtual classroom series on how schools can combat discrimination and provide districts up to $200,000 to support teacher training regarding anti-racism and bias. A handful of Democratic lawmakers have signed on to create additional paths for schools to address racism.  “While President Trump and Secretary DeVos try to implement some sort of revisionist history propaganda program in our schools, California is leading the way in using education to end bigotry, hate and racism,” Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, which will help offer professional development for teachers, said at a news conference.  Chair of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), accused Trump on Monday of trying to indoctrinate kids with his 1776 Commission. “We know that in 1776, Black people were generally slaves, women had no legal identity beyond their husbands and being LGBTQ was a capital offense,” he said.  The S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation will fund the school grants, while the National Equity Project and the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of Tolerance have also signed on to help.  “We know that racism and hate are taught. We know that children are born loving everyone,” said Sen. Connie Leyva (D-Chino), chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus. “You learn what you live, and unfortunately racism and hate are still being taught in living rooms across the state of California and across this country.”'}\n",

The developers pulled the plug on Tuesday, six years after launching the undertaking, citing the growing political opposition and the absence of a champion in City Hall.  The outcome for Industry City reflects the growing influence of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose south Brooklyn chapter opposed the project’s approval. The trend has sitting politicians in some sections of the city worried they’ll face tough primaries if they don’t appear adequately aligned with left-leaning groups.  “It’s pure politics, which we can’t afford right now,” said Kathy Wylde, head of the influential business consortium, Partnership for New York City.  Developers were seeking a zoning change to expand the waterfront complex and allow more businesses, retail and academic space at the site. They were making the case to the City Council that the expected benefits merited the plan’s approval over the objection of local Council Member Carlos Menchaca, who would otherwise be given veto authority under the Council’s traditions. The argument seemed to have more weight as much of the city’s development has frozen amid the Covid-19 pandemic and New York stares down a steep drop in tax revenue.  But the path forward became shakier as Council Speaker Corey Johnson and Mayor Bill de Blasio remained largely absent from the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. And a letter sent to Council members Tuesday from Brooklyn’s congressional delegation and several state lawmakers — who argued the project would accelerate gentrification and displacement in the neighborhood — reflected growing opposition from powerful political players.  Industry City CEO Andrew Kimball said Thursday the “lack of interest at all levels, but particularly at the City Council, in engaging in a constructive dialogue” on the substance of the proposal contributed to the decision to scrap the rezoning.  “It’s hard in a process like this when you don’t have somebody on the other side who seems eager, willing to come to the table to negotiate a plan,” he said on a call with reporters. “That became very clear, that there wasn’t that willingness.”  The left’s efforts on fighting gentrification already had real political consequences for establishment Democrats. In Sunset Park, longtime Assemblymember Felix Ortiz lost the seat he’d held since 1994 to newcomer Marcela Mitaynes, a tenant activist and vocal rezoning opponent, this past July. De Blasio recently backed out of a new plan for the former Amazon site in Queens over concerns about a lack of community investment.  Kimball said he heard frequently from politicians through the rezoning process that, while they liked the substance of the proposal, they couldn’t support it given the politics of the moment.  Velázquez recruited other members of Congress to sign the Tuesday letter, including Jeffries and Yvette Clarke, both of whom represent neighboring districts, according to two of the sources. Jeffries, who is considered a moderate Democrat and has risen the ranks of House leadership, raised eyebrows as one of the signatories.  “It was kind of the nail in the coffin,” said one Council official who, like other sources in this story, requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject. “The electeds in Brooklyn lean on him and his voice is very powerful. He’s a common sense elected official, he’s not far left, so when he speaks, people listen and follow.”  Jeffries’ opposition came despite support for the project from many of his political allies, including clergy members and other central Brooklyn elected officials, according to a Brooklyn political consultant who asked to remain anonymous.  “Now [Jeffries and others] have to go back and answer to these community members, predominantly Black ones, who are like, ‘Why would you do that?’” the person said.  Johnson, the City Council speaker who until this week was considering a run for mayor, remained noncommittal as discussions on the project continued. On Wednesday, he noted the widespread opposition to the plan from local elected officials, saying Menchaca “had a united front.”  “The developer was not able to make the case or convince, not just the elected officials who represent the area, but a broader set of elected officials in the borough of Brooklyn,” Johnson said at a press conference. “If you can’t convince the local elected officials then that tells you where things are going to go. I don’t think it’s appropriate to think that I’m going to jump in and say that I know better than every local elected official.”  De Blasio, meanwhile, repeatedly declined to get involved when asked about the plan in recent weeks. The mayor, also a Democrat who ran as a progressive, has largely stepped back from his development agenda, once a core focus of his mayoralty.  The Council generally defers to the position of local members on land use projects. However, after Menchaca announced his opposition to the project in late July, other Council Members urged the body to support the proposal anyway. Council Members Ritchie Torres and Donovan Richards wrote a New York Daily News op-ed arguing the Council’s member deference tradition shouldn’t doom a project that could generate thousands of jobs during an economic crisis.

The op-ed angered Velázquez, and her involvement grew as she sensed the project may pass over Menchaca’s opposition, two sources said.  A spokesperson for Velázquez did not make her available for an interview.  “The Congresswoman got involved because members of the local community were alarmed this massive rezoning was being rushed through and would have accelerated displacement during an economic crisis that is already disproportionately harming working immigrant families,” spokesperson Alex Haurek said in an email.  Menchaca and Sunset Park activists who opposed the rezoning declared victory after POLITICO first reported this week, the developers were pulling the application.  “[Industry City] attempted to use their money and influence to circumvent the community-backed position and win over Council Members,” Menchaca said in a statement on Wednesday. “Despite these efforts to divide the community and the Council, they couldn’t defeat the power of the people coming together to protect their neighborhood.”  “This is sending a message to elected officials and developers that development can no longer look like this,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director at UPROSE, a local environmental justice group that fought the plans.  Business and civic leaders, as well as politicians who supported the project, lamented the fate of the rezoning.  \"I thought more weight would have been given by elected officials to the economic circumstances we’re in,” said James Whelan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. \"We have unemployment approaching the Great Depression, we and others are issuing reports every month that demonstrate how private investment is shrinking in New York City...That whole issue just seems to have been thrown to the wind here.\"  Sally Goldenberg contributed reporting.

They’re finding common cause with Cuban-Americans, who dominate Spanish-language radio airwaves and have been a bulwark of Republican support in Florida’s otherwise Democratic-leaning and diverse Hispanic communities.  But where radio is easy to hear for all, Facebook is harder to track. And the encrypted messaging system it bought, WhatsApp, is even more difficult.  WhatsApp group chats are widely popular among Latin Americans and other immigrant communities in the U.S. because the app doesn\\'t require a U.S. phone number or specific mobile service provider, making it easy to stay in touch with family abroad via text or voice communication. Group chats within the closed network can easily be created with dozens of people anywhere in the world. Plus, iPhones aren’t as popular in Latin America — meaning iMessage chats are not an option for many.  Political campaigns, social justice movements and support groups have followed along, making WhatsApp a top tool for reaching voters in Latin America and from Latin America.  In South Florida, veteran Latino Democratic strategist Evelyn Pérez-Verdia noticed this summer that the WhatsApp groups dedicated to updates on the pandemic and news for the Colombian and Venezuelan communities became intermittently interspersed with conspiracy theories from videos of far-right commentators or news clips from new Spanish-language sites, like Noticias 24 and PanAm Post, and the YouTube-based Informativo G24 website.  “I’ve never seen this level of disinformation, conspiracy theories and lies,” Pérez-Verdia, who is of Colombian descent, said. “It looks as if it has to be coordinated.”  Republicans say people on both sides of the political aisle are sharing disinformation organically, although they can’t point to similar conspiracy theories espoused by the left. And they accuse Democrats of labeling every opinion or news story they disagree with as disinformation.  For instance, in a Covid WhatsApp chat group, a Republican posted a statement that real Catholics can’t be Democrats, which Pérez-Verdia found objectionable. But the group chat’s founder and administrator, businessman and former Republican Miami-Dade County Commission candidate Alfred Santamaria, said he didn’t ban the comment because he believed people should have freedom of expression.

Still, Santamaria conceded, political toxicity is rising on the platform.  “I see more tension, more fighting, more radicalism. I see a level of tension of people posting for and against the administration,” he said.  Some of the information shared in chat groups and pulled from YouTube and Facebook goes beyond hyperbolic and caustic rhetoric.  On Informativo G24, longtime Colombian news anchor Sandra Valencia brings on guests via webcam for discussions about Latin America and U.S. politics with analysis that often relies on conspiracy theories, such as how Black Lives Matter and other activist groups are planning a “siege” on the White House later this month. The site does not detail who funds it, but asks supporters to donate to a PayPal account registered to Valencia.  Valencia bills her Spanish-language YouTube page, which has more than 378,000 followers, as a channel for geopolitical analysis. But it often resembles English-language right-wing news sources, such as Infowars, sharing conspiracy theories and strong anti-globalization messages.  And unlike the conspiracy theories that circulate in English-language news media and social media, there’s relatively little to no Spanish-language media coverage of the phenomenon nor a political counterpunch from the left.  Some of the disinformation discussed on Informativo G24 has been led by Omar Bula-Escobar, a former United Nations representative and Colombian geopolitical analyst, who in recent years has become a frequent guest on various Latin American radio and television news shows to talk about globalization. Bula-Escobar, who’s also a frequent guest on Miami-based Radio Caracol — which is one of Colombia’s main radio networks and widely respected throughout Latin America — has gained an increasing amount of notoriety for pushing the claim, often seen as anti-Semitic, that billionaire George Soros is “the world’s biggest puppet master” and is the face of the American Democratic Party.  “Who’s going to celebrate the day, God forbid, Trump loses? Cuba; ISIS, which Trump ended; Hezbollah, which Obama gave the greenlight to enter Latin America; Iran; China … All the filth of the planet is against Donald Trump. So, if you want to be part of the filth, then go with the filth,” Bula-Escobar said in a recent episode of Informativo G24.  Other shared content has included a translated clip of Christian conservative pastor John MacArthur claiming there is no pandemic and coronavirus death numbers have been wildly exaggerated.  In June, a Noticias 24, a Venezuela-focused news site that has a large following in Latin America, amplified disinformation with a story bearing the headline “social networks also accuse Joe Biden of being a pedophile.” A month later, when the lie resurfaced, “#BidenPedofilio” trended in Spain.  On Facebook, a Puerto Rican-born pastor Melvin Moya has circulated a video titled “Signs of pedophilia” with doctored videos of Biden inappropriately touching girls at various public ceremonies to a song in the background that says, “I sniffed a girl and I liked it.” The fake video posted on Sept. 1 has received more than 33,000 likes and 2,400 comments.  Much of the shared content cannot be traced to a specific campaign or political organization. Still, fake videos and news stories are being widely shared in Facebook groups offering support for Trump.  And various fake stories across WhatsApp and Facebook claim that Nicolás Maduro’s socialist party in Venezuela and U.S. communist leaders are backing Biden.  “It’s really just a free-for-all now,” said Raúl Martínez, a Democrat who served as mayor of the largely conservative, heavily Cuban-American city of Hialeah for 24 years and is now host of a daily radio show on Radio Caracol. “It’s mind boggling. I started in politics when I was 20. I’ve never seen it like this.”  Martínez, 71, said it has been particularly frustrating to see the prevalence of disinformation in South Florida Spanish-language stations, which many older Latinos in the area still rely on for information.  “When I hear from other stations, they haven’t just sipped the Kool-Aid. They drank the whole thing,” Martínez said.  Radio Caracol, for its part, received unwelcome attention Aug. 22 when it aired 16 minutes of paid programming from a local businesssman who launched into an anti-Black and anti-Semitic rant that claimed a Biden victory would mean that the U.S. would fall into a dictatorship led by “Jews and Blacks.” The commentator claimed that Biden is leading a political revolution “directed by racial minorities, atheists and anti-Christians” and supports killing newborn babies.  When Miami state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Colombian-American who is also Jewish, heard the programming, she quickly called out the station on Twitter for “the disgusting message, spoken by Trump supporters,” adding that “We all — regardless of parties — have an obligation to repudiate and condemn this pro-Nazi and racist discourse.”  However, the 16-minute program did not receive coverage from local media outlets despite the outwardly racist and xenophobic messaging, a reminder that much of the Spanish-language disinformation and conspiracy theories circulating in South Florida remain unchecked.  Caracol management promptly apologized for the content and said it banned the commentator, local businessman Jorge Gonzalez, from the airwaves. A Caracol spokesman said Gonzalez had initially purchased the radio time to talk about business, not politics, let alone racist politics. Gonzalez couldn’t be reached for comment.  Then, on Friday, the editor of the Spanish-language sister paper of The Miami Herald, El Nuevo Herald, publicly apologized for its own paid-media scandal after running a publication called “Libre” as a newspaper insert that attacked Black Lives Matter and trafficked in anti-Semitic views.  \"What kind of people are these Jews? They\\'re always talking about the Holocaust, but have they already forgotten Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs rampaged through Jewish shops all over Germany? So do the BLM and Antifa, only the Nazis didn\\'t steal; they only destroyed,” the ad insert said .  The publication said it\\'s suspending its relationship with Libre.  Conspiracy theories — especially revolving around QAnon, which posits that Trump is fighting a global cabal of satanic pedophiles — are spreading across Spanish-language radio in Miami as well, said Roberto Tejera, a political independent who has a show on Actualidad Radio. Tejera said QAnon is a constant on another station, La Poderosa, whose station management also did not respond to messages seeking comment.  “It’s not right wing. I don’t have a problem with right-wing stuff. It’s QAnon stuff. This is conspiracy theory. This goes beyond. This is new. This is a new phenomenon in Spanish speaking radio. We Cubans are not normal,” Tejera laughed, “but this is new. This is crazy. This is f---ing crazy.”    '}\n",

Deemed “the most important woman lawyer in the history of the Republic,” Ginsburg did urge courts to draw a once-novel conclusion about the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids government from “deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”: that it should operate to stop arbitrary laws based on gender.  Note that “person,” “equal,” and “protection” are all terms the Constitution does not explicitly define. Absent a constitutional amendment—which takes an affirmative vote of two-thirds of both houses of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states—these words are among many in the Constitution that the Supreme Court must ultimately define. (Congress can provide legislative definitions, but the high court can strike those down.) Because the constitutional text is vague, for many years the Equal Protection Clause was read to tolerate laws that effectively deprived women of the same opportunities men enjoyed in all realms of public life. That narrow, male-only reading of the Constitution allowed the government to ban women from working as lawyers or bartenders, for example. It prevented women from serving on juries or lifting more than 15 pounds on the job. Through her work as a lawyer and jurist, Ginsburg prompted the Supreme Court to read the Equal Protection Clause to constrain arbitrary legal constraints on people of all genders.  Is this a radical, leftist idea? Would a more conservative approach have confined the meanings of “person,” “equal,” and “protection” to the prevailing understanding of those terms in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was ratified amid post-Civil War Reconstruction? Some judges, lawyers and scholars would argue that only the original public meaning is relevant even today. But in 1868, Webster defined the word “protection” to include numerous meanings, including “[t]he act of protecting or preserving from evil, injury, or annoyance,” as well as a slew of synonyms: “Preservation; guard; shelter; refuge; security; safety.” Which of these would a conservative judge pick? Which would a liberal one choose? The fact that this exercise doesn’t fit neatly into political definitions of liberal and conservative is something Ginsburg acutely understood.  You probably know what I’m getting at here: Many people—even some with a nuanced understanding of legal and constitutional interpretation—argue that “good” judges do not read anything into the Constitution, but stick to its plain language (so-called “textualists” or “originalists), and “bad” judges treat the document as a blank slate on which to craft a wish list for social reform (so-called “living constitutionalists”). Ginsburg defied this false dichotomy by routinely applying conservative analytic principles in the service of causes that might be considered politically liberal. Yet troublingly, this false dichotomy has become de rigueur in our national conversation about presidential candidates and potential Supreme Court picks. It is corrosive.  For Ginsburg, adherence to procedure, principles of federalism, judicial independence and ensuring that government does not wield arbitrary power over regular people were hallmarks of her jurisprudence. This list is not stereotypically progressive. If anything, it has marks of conservatism.  On what remains perhaps the most sensitive constitutional question of our time, whether the Constitution protects against government’s interference in a woman’s decision to medically terminate a pregnancy, Ginsburg was critical of the court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, which lodged abortion rights—rather precariously, it turns out—as a matter of privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. For her, it was more about gender equality under the Equal Protection Clause.  Although both due process and equal protection appear in the 14th Amendment, due process has its roots in English common law, dating as far back as the Magna Carta of 1215. The notion is that the government cannot take someone’s life, liberty and property without fair notice and a hearing. But the Constitution doesn’t specify protections for numerous liberties that most Americans would assume are bound up in the idea of freedom from arbitrary confinement. So the Supreme Court long ago identified certain basic rights as nonetheless protected under the Due Process Clause, including the right to decide one’s own medical care and to raise children according to one’s own values and not the dictates of the government. It’s this concept of “substantive” due process that undergirds Roe.  By contrast, equal protection is a uniquely American standard that was designed to stop states from discriminating against formerly enslaved Black people. Ginsburg perceived equal protection as a more natural means of ensuring a woman’s ability to keep government out of her personal medical decisions relating to the female reproductive system. Ginsburg also feared that Roe went too fast for the public which, ironically, had been steadily moving toward legalizing abortion through state legislatures, not the courts. The court “ventured too far in the change it ordered in Roe,” she wrote in a 1985 law review article.  On a range of other cases, Ginsburg cast votes that were not decidedly liberal, and in fact might have gone differently had she been an elected politician and not a judge with life tenure.  Consider, for example, Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, in which Ginsburg in 2002 dissented from the majority’s decision that struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a Minnesota canon of judicial conduct that barred candidates for elected judgeships from publicly expressing their political views. Like Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, Ginsburg was a reliable defender of First Amendment rights, writing numerous majority opinions. But in White, she took the position that candidates for elected judgeships must sacrifice certain constitutional rights if they are to preserve another “essential bulwark of constitutional government,” i.e., “[t]he guarantee of an independent, impartial judiciary.” For Ginsburg, “[u]nlike their counterparts in the political branches, judges are expected to refrain from catering to particular constituencies or committing themselves on controversial issues in advance of adversarial presentation.” (To be sure, Ginsburg stoked controversy when she publicly expressed concerns about Donald Trump’s possible election in 2016.)  Scalia took direct aim at Ginsburg in his opinion, expressly rejecting her “resort to the notion that the First Amendment provides less protection during an election campaign than at other times.” But Ginsburg’s emphasis on judicial restraint, favoring social change through the legislature rather than through the courts, is hardly a touchstone of liberalism. One could argue that her defense of judicial independence is no less an example of classic conservative jurisprudence than Scalia’s insistence on unfettered free speech. The unabashedly conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch has likewise insisted that the Constitution’s framers “charged individuals insulated from political pressures with the job of interpreting the law and applying it retroactively to resolve past disputes.”  In a 2019 case called United States v. Sineneng-Smith, as well, Ginsburg wrote an opinion for a unanimous court reversing a 9th Circuit ruling that a federal statute making it a felony to encourage entry of aliens into the United States violated the First Amendment on free speech grounds. The case arose from a conviction of a California-based immigration consultant who was prosecuted and convicted under the law. Despite her strong support for First Amendment and immigrant rights, Ginsburg wrote that “the Ninth Circuit’s radical transformation of this case goes well beyond the pale.”  Also in 2019, she voted with conservative Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh to reject a criminal defendant’s argument that his period of supervised release cannot be paused during his detention over a new criminal offense, concluding that pretrial detention does not qualify as imprisonment within the meaning of federal law. Gorsuch joined Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan in dissent, charging the majority with misconstruing the law and creating “needless uncertainty and unfairness.” Court watchers were surprised by the ideological breakdown.  Just this year, Ginsburg joined Kagan’s majority opinion in Kelly v. United States, which reversed the fraud convictions of two associates of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in connection with their closure of several lanes of the George Washington Bridge in retaliation against a local mayor’s refusal to endorse Christie for reelection. Kagan reasoned that the scheme did not aim to obtain money or property so as to trigger the criminal fraud laws. Christie, of course, is a Republican.  Ginsburg also sided this year with the conservative wing of the court in endorsing the construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline beneath the Appalachian Trail—to the chagrin of environmentalists—as well as the Trump administration’s policy of expediting deportation of people seeking asylum in the United States. In the latter case, Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, Ginsburg again opted to reverse a decision of the famously liberal-leaning 9th Circuit.  Consider, too, Ginsburg’s adherence to principles of federalism—the view that states’ autonomy is essential to confining the grandiose power of the federal government. This, again, is an approach to constitutional interpretation that typically leans conservative. In BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, she penned a dissent to the majority’s 1996 decision to strike down a $2 million punitive damage award that had been upheld by Alabama courts on due process grounds. “The Court,” she wrote, “unnecessarily and unwisely venture[d] into territory traditionally within the States’ domain.”  Somewhat remarkably, as a D.C. Circuit judge Ginsburg dissented from that court’s majority opinion striking down the Ethics in Government Act, a statute passed in the wake of the Nixon Watergate scandal that authorized appointment of a prosecutor outside the president’s chain of command to look into alleged presidential wrongdoing. On appeal, a 7-1 majority of the Supreme Court in 1988 adopted her view in Morrison v. Olson, upholding the law (which eventually expired). Six years later, independent counsel Kenneth Starr was appointed under the law for purposes of investigating President Bill Clinton, the man who put Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. Clinton was later impeached based on Starr’s report of his findings. Famously, Scalia dissented in the Morrison case.  Perhaps in an ironic twist, it was Joe Biden as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee who argued in his questioning of Ginsburg that judges ought to lead society in some circumstances. As a Supreme Court nominee being interviewed for the job, then-Judge Ginsburg demurred. “Judges must be mindful of what their place is in this system and must always remember that we live in a democracy that can be destroyed if judges take it upon themselves to rule as Platonic guardians,” she said.  The Senate should heed Justice Ginsburg’s exquisitely blended strains of legal conservativism and liberalism as they contemplate who has the intellectual rigor, honesty and temperament to replace her.'}\n",

BREAKING OVERNIGHT: L.A. TIMES: “Two L.A. County sheriff’s deputies shot, critically wounded in attack captured on video,” by Doug Smith, Matthew Ormseth and Richard Winton: “Two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies were critically wounded after being shot Saturday evening in Compton in what authorities described as an ‘ambush’ that was captured on surveillance video.  “The video, released by the department, shows a man walking up to the deputies’ parked patrol car, pulling out a gun and firing several times into the front seat area from the passenger side. The assailant is then seen running from the scene.”  L.A.

People\\'s lives are at stake when ambulances can\\'t get through.”  THE PRESIDENT, who is in Las Vegas this morning, tweeted at 1:05 a.m. about the ambush: “Animals that must be hit hard!”  GABBY ORR in Minden, Nev.: “Trump fumes over Biden ad, media coverage at Nevada rally”: “President Donald Trump set the tone early on at his rally in northern Nevada Saturday night, warning that he was prepared to \"be really vicious\" in the final weeks of the presidential campaign.  “Fuming over a new ad about his alleged disparagement of U.S. military personnel, Trump arrived here with a torrent of insults ready to go. ‘Pathetic Joe. He’s a pathetic human being to allow that to happen,’ Trump said of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and the ad Biden\\'s campaign released last week, which seized on comments Trump reportedly made about America’s fallen soldiers.  “‘But you know the good part?’ Trump continued. ‘Now I can be really vicious. Once I saw that ad, I don’t have to be nice anymore.’ The president also claimed Biden, ‘doesn’t know he’s alive.’ ‘Sleepy Joe Biden. You know where he is now?

SYMONE SANDERS said it on ABC’S “THIS WEEK” and JAKE SULLIVAN said it on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY.” Here’s SANDERS: “Look, George, in January and February, Joe Biden was not being briefed by national security experts who warned him how deadly the virus was. In January and February, Joe Biden did not have the knowledge that President Trump did.”  CHUCK TODD had RNC CHAIR RONNA MCDANIEL on NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS” … ON THE GOP CASH SITUATION … “So if you look at the RNC fundraising from January 2019 to July, which is the cycle, we raised $493 million and the DNC\\'s raised $203 million.

And last week, the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia visited the White House to announce normalized economic relations that could help end decades-old hostilities. At the same time, Mr. Trump is withdrawing more American troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.”  BLOOMBERG TO SPEND 10% OF WHAT HE SPENT ON HIS QUIXOTIC CAMPAIGN TO HELP JOE BIDEN IN FLORIDA, via WaPo’s Michael Scherer: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to spend at least $100 million in Florida to help elect Democrat Joe Biden, a massive late-stage infusion of cash that could reshape the presidential contest in a costly toss-up state central to President Trump’s reelection hopes.  “Bloomberg made the decision to focus his final election spending on Florida last week, after news reports that Trump had considered spending as much as $100 million of his own money in the final weeks of the campaign, Bloomberg’s advisers said. Presented with several options on how to make good on an earlier promise to help elect Biden, Bloomberg decided that a narrow focus on Florida was the best use of his money.” WaPo  -- AS NYT’S ALEX BURNS POINTS OUT: “this is both a big move in the 2020 spending picture & another data point in Bloomberg\\'s pullback from commitments during the primary. $100 million is massive for a 1-state program. it\\'s also not close to the mother-of-all-Dem super PACs his aides promised”  POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from POLITICO and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

NYT’S ASTEAD HERNDON in Duluth: “Minnesota Seemed Ripe for a Trump Breakout. It Has Not Arrived.”: “If any state is positioned to go from blue to red in 2020, to embrace the fullness of Trumpology and provide the president some much-needed Electoral College insurance, it is Minnesota.  “The state’s northern and eastern regions have grown more conservative over the years, and Republicans won two House seats in the state during the 2018 midterm elections -- a rare bright spot during an election characterized by an anti-Trump wave. Going into 2020, conservatives crowed that the issues that defined the state’s politics were straight from Mr. Trump’s playbook: in particular, a robust refugee relocation program that has inspired a white backlash in certain places outside the Twin Cities. …  “Mr. Biden’s advantage is driven by an erosion of Republican support for Mr. Trump in the state’s metropolitan areas, continuing the trend of suburban voters’ fleeing a president in crisis. In interviews, several of the voters reached for the Times poll, particularly those in suburban and rural regions that are bellwethers for the state, described rejecting Mr. Trump’s pitch about law and order and focusing on themes Mr. Biden has tried to stress: decency, experience, and Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.”  BERNIE FRETS … WAPO’S SEAN SULLIVAN: “Bernie Sanders expresses concerns about Biden campaign”: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is privately expressing concerns about Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations, and is urging Biden’s team to intensify its focus on pocketbook issues and appeals to liberal voters.  “Sanders, the runner-up to Biden in the Democratic primaries, has told associates that Biden is at serious risk of coming up short in the November election if he continues his vaguer, more centrist approach, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive talks. The senator has identified several specific changes he’d like to see, saying Biden should talk more about health care and about his economic plans, and should campaign more with figures popular among young liberals, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).”  ALEX THOMPSON and LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ: “The surprise religious group that could decide Trump\\'s fate”: “In 2016, Mormons rejected Donald Trump in numbers unheard of for a Republican nominee — viewing the thrice-married, immigrant-bashing Republican as an affront to their values. In 2020, the president is going all-out to change [Mormons] minds — a little-noticed effort that could make or break him in Arizona and Nevada, home to more than a half-million Latter-day Saints combined. Joe Biden\\'s campaign, sensing an unlikely opening for a Democrat, is also targeting Mormons in the pair of Western swing states.”  WAPO’S JENNA JOHNSON: “They voted for him and now regret it. Why White women are turning away from Trump.”  PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: “A Pennsylvania town once known as ‘communism on the prairie’ is all about Trump now,” by Julia Terruso in Norvelt, Pa.: “Trump signs are everywhere. And the president’s framing of his campaign against Democrat Joe Biden as an existential fight against creeping socialism in America is rallying voters here. Disaffected current and former Democrats in surrounding Westmoreland County, and across small Rust Belt towns in Southwestern and Northeastern Pennsylvania, make up the core of Trump’s support in the state. These onetime Democratic bastions swung hard to Trump.  “After the 2004 presidential race was a near-tie here, two-thirds of Norvelt voters backed Trump in 2016. And four years later, Republicans have added more than 10,000 registered voters in Westmoreland County. Trump may need even more support from places like this in 2020, as suburban voters have moved away from him in a state he won by less than 1 percentage point.”  NPR’S ASMA KHALID: “Republicans Are Knocking On Doors. Democrats Aren\\'t. Biden\\'s Campaign Says That\\'s OK”  GREAT PAUL KANE COLUMN: “House of Representatives, and its longest-serving Democrat, adapts to the pandemic”: “Yet [Steny] Hoyer (D-Md.) has found himself at the forefront of one of the most radical changes to how the House conducts its business in decades. As Congress pulled together earlier this year to approve nearly $3 trillion worth of rescue legislation amid the coronavirus pandemic, lawmakers struggled to do their jobs in a safe and socially distanced manner.  “Pushed by rank-and-file Democrats to adapt, as the rest of America has done, Hoyer led a group that came up with new rules allowing lawmakers to vote from home to avoid risky travel and implementing technological changes that created virtual hearings in which members and witnesses could appear through video conferencing. …  “Elected in 1981, Hoyer has locked down support for another term as majority leader -- as Democrats are expected to hold the majority -- through 2022, which will mark 20 years as the No. 2 leader behind Pelosi.  “He said he wakes up ‘angry’ every day and wants to keep serving as long as he is physically up to the task. After years of craving the speaker’s gavel, Hoyer no longer views the promotion to the top job as something necessary to complete a career that began 60 years ago as an intern. ‘If you told me I was going to be the number two leader in the House of Representatives for 20 years, I would have said, ‘I would have died and gone to heaven.’ I would have said, ‘Oh, I can’t believe that.’ This job that I have is a wonderful job,’ Hoyer said.”  -- THAT LAST PARAGRAPH -- that HOYER no longer views ascension to the speakership as “necessary,” is super interesting. For many years, the opposite was assumed -- perhaps incorrectly.  WHITMER UNDER PRESSURE … AP/LANSING: “Group tops 400K signatures to repeal Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\\'s virus powers,” by David Eggert: “Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, faced with lawsuits challenging her use of emergency powers to fight the coronavirus, could continue to prevail in court.  “But she may be unable to stop a Republican maneuver that would rescind a 75-year-old law that has enabled her to issue and lift COVID-19 restrictions unilaterally. A ballot drive said Friday it was in the \"home stretch\" after collecting more than 400,000 signatures in just two months. Its goal is 500,000.  “If at least 340,000 signatures are deemed valid by the state elections board, the GOP-controlled Legislature would likely repeal the 1945 law rather than let it go to a 2022 public vote. The Democratic governor could not veto the initiated bill. A 1976 law, which requires legislative approval to extend a state of emergency, would remain intact.”  MUST READ … DARIUS TAHIR and RACHEL ROUBEIN: “Trump officials race against time to build massive new vaccine tracking system”: “The Trump administration is betting it can get millions of coronavirus shots to the Americans who need them most using a new, unproven data system that threatens to bypass state trackers that have long been mainstays in public immunization programs.”  PLAYBOOK READS  PHOTO DU JOUR: A man carries a bucket of water to put out a tree still smoldering on his property destroyed by a wildfire on Saturday, Sept. 12, in Mill City, Ore. | John Locher/AP Photo  THE DAILY BEAST: “Sen. David Perdue Says His Perfectly Timed Stock Trades Are Completely Innocent,” by Sam Brodey: “Two weeks after Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) helped to dilute a rule that governed the prepaid debit card industry, he reported acquiring stock in a company that stood to benefit from the rollback of those regulations.  “In early 2017, Perdue was pushing to overturn a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau measure that, among other things, imposed new regulations on the growing prepaid debit card industry—including requirements that they be more transparent about fees and penalties, and extend the fraud and theft protections enjoyed by normal account holders to those with prepaid cards. The rule was not completely overturned, as Perdue wished, but it was rolled back. …  “Perdue’s office told The Daily Beast that all of those transactions—involving First Data and every other company -- are handled by a third-party investment adviser, and that the senator has no role in buying or selling the securities in his portfolio.  “‘As we have told numerous publications in response to repeated false accusations, Senator Perdue and Mrs. Perdue have outside, independent advisers who made these specific trades,’ said a Senate spokeswoman for Perdue. ‘The Perdues cannot direct or influence these independent fund managers. These outrageous attacks are based on information that has been publicly available for years. Any accusation of improper conduct is categorically false and nothing more than lies by liberal groups hoping to win an election.’”  A message from Facebook: It’s time for updated regulations to improve privacy standards We continue to take action to build privacy into our products and give people the tools to help manage their privacy like Privacy Checkup and Off-Facebook Activity.

He doesn’t face any other fines or penalties for wearing the hat at the Johns Creek Environmental Campus early voting location on Oct. 29, 2016.  “Red ‘Make America Great Again’ hats are an expression of support for Republican President Donald Trump, but Holsworth said his hat didn’t mention Trump by name.  “Holsworth told the board he always wears a hat because he has skin cancer, and he removed it when asked by a poll worker. ‘I didn’t feel like I was electioneering or anything like that. I was just coming in to vote. I don’t even know if there were any other voters there,’ Holsworth said during the State Election Board meeting. ‘When asked to take it off, I was so surprised, but I did it.’”  LUNCH WITH THE FT … KIM DARROCH: “‘I thought it would be trial by tweet’”: “As our blueberry tarts arrive, he discloses that someone in the Trump administration called to say sorry for what happened. Who? ‘Ha, ha, ha. I can’t tell you who, I’m afraid. It would be too risky for them. Honestly it would put their position at risk.’ He also received a five-minute phone call from Johnson on the day he quit, although the prospective prime minister did not exactly apologise.  “Darroch believes that Trump can win this year’s US election. ‘If you gave me £100 and held a gun to my head, I’d put it on Biden,’ he says over coffee. ‘But I would never spend my own money on that bet. I think it will get nasty on the streets whichever way it goes.’  “Whoever wins, he expects Johnson to quickly try to do a trade deal with the US as a big post-Brexit statement. The former ambassador is sceptical such a deal will be possible without ‘a substantial concession on agriculture’ from the Brits — something that may prove hard to deliver.

A massive scoop by DAN DIAMOND landed at 10:25 p.m. Friday night: “Trump officials interfered with CDC reports on Covid-19”  -- DAN’S STORY deserves a full read, but here are some highlights: “The health department’s politically appointed communications aides have demanded the right to review and seek changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly scientific reports charting the progress of the coronavirus pandemic, in what officials characterized as an attempt to intimidate the reports’ authors and water down their communications to health professionals.  “In some cases, emails from communications aides to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other senior officials openly complained that the agency’s reports would undermine President Donald Trump’s optimistic messages about the outbreak, according to emails reviewed by POLITICO and three people familiar with the situation. …  “[S]ince Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign official with no medical or scientific background, was installed in April as the health department’s new spokesperson, there have been substantial efforts to align the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports] with Trump’s statements, including the president’s claims that fears about the outbreak are overstated, or stop the reports altogether.  “Caputo and his team have attempted to add caveats to the CDC’s findings, including an effort to retroactively change agency reports that they said wrongly inflated the risks of Covid-19 and should have made clear that Americans sickened by the virus may have been infected because of their own behavior, according to the individuals familiar with the situation and emails reviewed by POLITICO. …  “In one clash, an aide to Caputo berated CDC scientists for attempting to use the reports to ‘hurt the President’ in an Aug. 8 email sent to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other officials that was widely circulated inside the department and obtained by POLITICO.”  BIG DURHAM NEWS … HARTFORD COURANT: “Nora Dannehy, Connecticut prosecutor who was top aide to John Durham’s Trump-Russia investigation, resigns amid concern about pressure from Attorney General William Barr,” by Edmund Mahoney: “Federal prosecutor Nora Dannehy, a top aide to U.S. Attorney John H. Durham in his Russia investigation, has quietly resigned — at least partly out of concern that the investigative team is being pressed for political reasons to produce a report before its work is done, colleagues said.  “Dannehy, a highly regarded prosecutor who has worked with or for Durham for decades, informed colleagues in the U.S. Attorney’s office in New Haven of her resignation from the Department of Justice by email Thursday evening. The short email was a brief farewell message and said nothing about political pressure, her work for Durham or what the Durham team has produced, according to people who received it. …  “Colleagues said Dannehy is not a supporter of President Trump and has been concerned in recent weeks by what she believed was pressure from Barr, who appointed Durham, to produce results before the election. They said she has been considering resigning for weeks, conflicted by loyalty to Durham and concern about politics.”  KYLE CHENEY: “Johnson seeks IG probe of wiped Mueller team phones”: “Senate Homeland Security Chair Ron Johnson is asking a Justice Department watchdog to probe recently revealed documents that suggest members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team wiped records from their official phones.  “Records released by the Justice Department this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request suggest top Mueller aides erased the information from at least 15 phones, citing forgotten passwords, physical damage and missing hardware.”  A message from Facebook: Facebook supports updated internet regulations We support updated internet regulations to set clear rules for today’s toughest challenges and hold companies, including Facebook, accountable for:  — Combating foreign election interference  — Protecting people's privacy  — Enabling safe and easy data portability between platforms  Read more  WHAT AMERICA IS READING … THE NATION’S FRONTS: S.F.

Bush administrations drafting plans for distributing vaccines and personal protective gear, dramatically ramping up testing, reopening schools and addressing health-care disparities.  “The effort began six months ago when the campaign consulted David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner under Presidents Bush and Bill Clinton, and Vivek H. Murthy, surgeon general under President Barack Obama, on how to run a presidential campaign during a pandemic.  “The pair, along with a growing cadre of volunteer health experts, has been working behind the scenes to craft plans that could take effect Jan. 20, when the next president will take the oath of office, said Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser on the Biden campaign.”  ELENA SCHNEIDER and ALEX THOMPSON: “Biden’s transition team, fearing Trump’s moves, sets massive fundraising goal”: “Joe Biden’s transition team has expanded its fundraising goal far beyond what Hillary Clinton raised in 2016, anticipating that, should they prevail in November, the Trump administration could actively work against their efforts and that the coronavirus pandemic will make a presidential changeover more difficult than ever.  “The Biden transition team is aiming to raise at least $7 million by Election Day and build a staff of at least 350 people, according to a person familiar with the transition’s planning, while another person said the total fundraising goal is $7 million to $10 million.  “The budget far exceeds the $2.1 million that Clinton raised for her transition planning by Election Day 2016, or the $6.5 million Trump’s transition raised before he assumed the presidency. Mitt Romney in 2012 raised $8.9 million for what is considered the most robust prior effort to plan a transition hand-off between two different parties.  “Several people involved in raising money for Biden’s transition said the pitch to potential donors leans on fears that President Donald Trump will not ease the handover process if he loses. That possible complication, along with the dueling health and economic crises hitting the country, will require more staffing and resources for a Biden administration-in-waiting.”  Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

SPORTS X POLITICS … NYT’S ALAN BLINDER and JONATHAN MARTIN: “Trump and Biden Seek an Electoral Edge From an Unlikely Source: College Football”: “Kevin Warren, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, was at his home near Minneapolis one morning this month when President Trump made a hastily arranged call to him.  “Warren’s league had decided in August to postpone fall sports because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Trump had a message as rife with political considerations as athletic ones: He hoped to see football revived in the Big Ten, a Power 5 conference home to schools like Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State and Wisconsin, fabled parts of a sports footprint that overlaps with many of America’s presidential battleground states.  “‘He made it very clear that he would help in any way that he possibly could to help us return to competition,’ Warren said on Friday evening in an interview, his first about his conversation with the president on Sept. 1. Taken together, the president’s lobbying campaign, amplified with Twitter blasts, and the advertisements of former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, blaming Trump for empty stadiums signal the potential potency of college football among some voters in the coming election. …  “Trump took interest in the season’s viability the day before the Big Ten’s decision, retweeting a post by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence in support of the athlete-driven #WeWantToPlay movement. Lawrence and Trump spoke later in the week by phone, the president said at a news conference on Aug. 15, when he mentioned the recent postponements by the Big Ten and the Pac-12 and said, ‘I wish they would come back.’ (Clemson, a member of the A.C.C., is playing this season.)  “The Big Ten’s move left Trump aides bombarded with requests for White House intervention. Many of the pleas went to Timothy Pataki, a senior official who played lacrosse at Ohio State and remained close to the school, among the most vocal in its opposition to the decision not to play on time this fall. Late last month, Pataki contacted Warren and asked whether he would be willing to speak with the president. Trump called the next morning.”  BIZ SAYS THANKS BUT NO THANKS TO TRUMP …  -- NYT’S JIM TANKERSLEY: “Trump’s Payroll Tax ‘Cut’ Fizzles”: “More than a month after Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to defer the collection of the payroll taxes that workers pay to help fund Social Security, few companies or people are taking part. Trade groups and tax experts say they know of no large corporations that plan to stop withholding employees’ payroll taxes this fall. As a result, economic policy experts now say they expect the deferral to have little to no effect on economic growth this year.”  -- WSJ’S RICH RUBIN: “Some Large Employers Reject Trump’s Payroll-Tax Deferral Plan”: “Some of the nation’s largest employers -- including CVS Health Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and the U.S. Postal Service -- say they won’t implement President Trump’s payroll-tax deferral plan, opting to leave employee paychecks alone this fall. …  “Other large employers, including United Parcel Service Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Home Depot Inc., say they aren’t participating either. Wells Fargo wanted ‘to avoid creating a future financial burden for employees,’ said spokesman Peter Gilchrist.”  PORTLAND PRESS HERALD: “Lively U.S. Senate debate puts front-runners Collins and Gideon on the hot seat,” by Kevin Miller: “[T]he debate … highlighted major policy differences between the two front-runners on issues such as access to quality health care. ‘We need to ensure access and that means maintaining our rural hospitals,’ said Collins, who is seeking a fifth six-year term in the Senate. ‘The proposal that Sara has endorsed would destroy our rural hospitals.’ …  “Trump also was a focal point in the debate, with Gideon at one pointing asking Collins a question that the senator has been fielding for months but so far has declined to answer: whom will she support in the upcoming presidential election.  “‘I don’t think that the people of Maine need my advice on whom to support for president,’ Collins replied. ‘Last week I was on a bus tour all over the state of Maine. Not a single person asked me who should be the next president. What they did say was how grateful they were for the Paycheck Protection Program that I wrote because it preserved their job or their small business.’”  POMPEO IN DUBAI … AP/DUBAI: “Warring Afghans meet to find peace after decades of war”  AXIOS’ BARAK RAVID: “Behind the scenes of the U.S.-brokered Israel-Bahrain agreement”: “After the visit in Israel and the UAE last week, [Jared] Kushner and his delegation traveled to Bahrain.

But the group's ethnical and cultural diversity makes it a particularly difficult one for the political world to understand, and an extremely difficult one for both parties to appeal to.  “That is one of the challenges I am most concerned about: that the Democrats and Biden haven’t done the work again to increase support among Latino voters,” said Valencia. “If the work has not been done to increase support among Latino voters in this last push, and white swing voters regress to the mean in any way … we are in a position where either the election is a lot closer than it should be — when there could have been greater margins — or we’ve lost the election on the margins.”  Valencia is encouraged by a new sense of urgency she has seen from the Biden campaign in recent weeks, including substantial investments in ads in Spanish-language media. “They’re not just translating their ads for the general electorate into Spanish — which is what you often see — or Google Translating ad copy and putting it up on the website,” said Valencia.  One point that concerns Valencia is where messaging intersects with a very real gender gap. Latina women support Biden over Trump by massive margins, but they vote at lower levels than white women or Black women. Combine that with the reality of campaigns — “you often end up focusing on the people we know are definitely going to vote [and] nonvoters get kind of stuck in a cycle of not being communicated with” — and Democrats are leaving potentially millions for Biden off the table.  As the presidential campaigns descend on swing states, Valencia spoke with POLITICO on Wednesday to sort through the complexities of the Latino vote — including the notion that there is such a thing. A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity.  Zack Stanton: We have less than seven weeks until the election. What is the state of the presidential race when it comes to Latino voters?  Stephanie Valencia: All paths to 270 [Electoral College votes] lead through the Latino electorate. Whether that path includes Arizona and Florida, or the upper-Midwest states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, every single path requires reaching and engaging Latino voters. There’s a very clear path forward for what needs to get done in the last 48 days, where the opportunity and the challenges still lie.  Historically, what we’ve seen happen is that maybe we get a poll or two of Latinos if a presidential campaign hires a pollster in time — and it may or may not be very robust. Otherwise, we’re kind of left with what we saw a couple of weeks ago out of the NBC/Marist poll in Florida, which kicked off a bunch of the panic we’ve seen over the last few weeks. But in that poll, the sample size of Hispanic likely voters was only 138.  Joe Biden, it’s no secret, didn’t win the Latino vote in the primary. There were some unique issues that Bernie Sanders was able to tap into that really related to the everyday lives of Latinos in this country, including universal access to quality health care, free community college and getting advanced degrees without acquiring a lot of debt, and immigration. And what our latest polling shows is that Joe Biden has been able to recoup and to consolidate a lot of that support, but there are obviously places where he needs to continue to do more.  Stanton: You mentioned the recent polls that are freaking out Democrats. Comparing Trump in polls now to 2016, he seems to be doing better among Latino voters. Why is that?  Valencia: You have to look state by state to really understand what’s driving that. When you look at a place like Florida, where a lot of the alarm was raised over the last week, by our measure, Biden is doing fairly well among Latinos: 53-37 head-to-head against Trump. That’s been a relatively stable marker.  We tend to look at Latino voters in Florida in a very binary way: If we’re not talking about Cubans, then we’re talking about Puerto Ricans. But only a third of the Latino electorate in Florida is actually Cuban-American — it’s very important, but it is only a third. More than one-third is actually not Cuban or Puerto Rican. They’re Mexican. They’re Colombian. They’re Peruvian. They’re Ecuadorian. Combined with the Puerto Rican community, they’re much more similar to each other than not.  Among that [non-Cuban Latino] community, I think the numbers are closer to 60-31 in favor of Biden. When you take Cuban-Americans out of the equation, there’s a much different picture in place in Florida, and a lot of room to have a conversation with a set of voters that campaigns don’t really talk about or think about communicating with — that non-Cuban, non-Puerto Rican population.  What’s interesting about the Cuban-American vote is that really since the Obama era, you have seen a lot of investment [by Republicans] in communicating the “socialism” message [about Democrats]. That has helped bring a lot of Cuban-Americans who may have voted for Obama home to the Republican Party. But fundamentally, there are still many chunks of that Cuban-American population that are persuadable and still gettable for Democrats.  That said, I don’t think Democrats should have a hand-to-hand combat message war over “socialism.” Where Trump has an Achilles’ heel — where he is weakest, even in a place like Florida with Cuban-Americans — is on health care, his handling of Covid and the current state of the economy. That’s really the proactive messaging that Biden and Democrats should be communicating.  Stanton: There’s typically this idea from pundits that Latino voters will recoil at the mention of “socialism.” Perhaps that’s true of Cuban-Americans in Florida. But what we saw from Bernie Sanders was quite the opposite — he had strong support from Latino voters. Why was that, and what did pundits get wrong?  Valencia: There are a couple really interesting takeaways from our research. One is the gender divide. Over the course of the last year, we’ve seen some pretty historic gaps between Hispanic men and Hispanic women. What’s interesting — relating back to Bernie — is that a lot of his support was not driven by young Hispanic men; it was actually driven by young Hispanic women. In the broader electorate, there was this picture of “Bernie Bros.” In the Latino community, it was actually young Latinas — often, non-college-educated single women — who, quite frankly, are a huge opportunity for Joe Biden. It’s one of the universes that we saw in this last round of research that really needs that nudge to vote for Biden.\"}\n",

The death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and President Donald Trump’s push to fill the seat ASAP has teed up one of the most ferocious and consequential confirmation battles in the Senate’s history, which is landing in the middle of the election season and amidst a global health pandemic.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — who is undeterred by accusations of hypocrisy and whose legacy will be defined by his confirmation of conservative Trump judges — is vowing to fill the vacancy this year. And McConnell has already locked down support from key Republicans to move ahead with a quick vote. Democrats, meanwhile, are promising to raise hell — and warning of possible payback if they win back the Senate.  Here’s everything you need to know about the historic Supreme Court showdown:  1) THE TIMING: It’s still up in the air when McConnell will hold a final confirmation vote, though he will get the ball rolling on the whole process as soon as Trump nominates a replacement, which is expected to happen soon. McConnell will huddle with his leadership team tonight and then meet with the entire Senate GOP conference for their weekly lunch on Tuesday, which could produce some more clarity on the timing issue.  But there’s two schools of thought here: McConnell could hold a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress, which could protect vulnerable Republicans who are up for reelection and allow the GOP to use the looming confirmation vote as a motivating factor to juice the base in November. This also makes the most sense from a calendar perspective, as the average Supreme Court confirmation process takes more than two months from start to finish.  Or, McConnell could try to wrap this up before Election Day. The benefit there is that if Trump loses the White House, some moderate Republicans might not be comfortable voting for the outgoing president’s nominee. Plus, McConnell might be working with a slimmer majority in the lame-duck if Democrat Mark Kelly wins a special election in Arizona and is sworn in this fall. But GOP Sen. Roy Blunt cautioned that “to get it done before Election Day everything has to work I think pretty precisely.”  2) THE MATH -- McConnell can only afford to lose three Republicans. Two GOP lawmakers — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have already publicly come out against holding a vote before the election. And Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden implored Republicans to “follow your conscience.”  But other key Republicans have lined up behind McConnell’s strategy of holding a swift vote. That includes retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander, an institutionalist; Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a top Trump ally who is up for reelection; Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a moderate; and Sens. Thom Tillis and Martha McSally, who are both in tough races.  Who we’re still waiting to hear from: Sen. Mitt Romney, who voted to convict the president during the impeachment trial and who has no loyalty to Trump; Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chaired the Judiciary Committee when Obama appointed (but the GOP refused to hold hearings on) Merrick Garland; and Sen. Cory Gardner, who is facing a competitive reelection battle in the purple state of Colorado and has hewed closely to Trump.  But as we’ve seen pretty consistently on Capitol Hill, the political calculation for most Republicans tends to be that they have more to lose than gain by bucking Trump. The latest on the whip count from Andrew and Nolan McCaskill: https://politi.co/32OIJBw .  3) THE DEM STRATEGY -- If McConnell has the votes for Trump’s nominee, there is nothing Democrats can do to stop the GOP from ramming it through. But Democrats may at least try to use some procedural tactics to slow down the process. Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Dems “have arrows in our quiver that I’m not about to discuss right now.”  But Pelosi shot down the idea of holding up government funding as a way to delay the Senate from filling the vacancy. Current government funding runs dry on Sept. 30 (more on that later). “None of us has any interest in shutting down government so I would hope that we could just proceed with that,” Pelosi told ABC’s “This Week.” But the truth is, there’s not a whole lot Dems can do here.  4) THE LONG-TERM IMPACT -- This partisan brawl will only further inflame an already polarized Senate, which could leave a long-lasting mark on the institution. In fact, progressives want Democrats to fight fire with fire — and Senate Dems are suggesting possible retaliation if they win back the Senate and the GOP succeeds in appointing Trump’s nominee to the high court.  During a Democratic conference call Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his colleagues that “nothing is off the table for next year” and “everything Americans value is at stake.” Progressives are not only pushing to eliminate the legislative filibuster, but also calling to expand the Supreme Court. And momentum for both ideas — which would fundamentally alter the institution — is only going to grow in the coming weeks. Much more from Marianne, Andrew and Bres: https://politi.co/2ZRXim8 .

Here’s the latest on the funding fight, from Caitlin Emma and Bres: “Congressional leaders missed a self-imposed deadline on Friday to strike an agreement on legislation that would keep the government open through Dec. 11, with House Democrats now hoping to file the stopgap spending bill by Monday.  “Lingering issues over a White House demand to deliver tens of billions of dollars in trade relief for farmers — which Democrats oppose — ultimately caused the delay, while lawmakers made progress in other areas. Democrats and Republicans have clashed for days over when the continuing resolution should expire and which funding and policy exceptions should be included.  “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were ticking through some of the biggest unresolved issues on Friday, congressional aides said. Earlier in the afternoon, it had appeared Democrats agreed to provide the farmer bailout in exchange for $2 billion in pandemic-related food assistance to help families with school-age children buy groceries.” More: https://politi.co/2ZXV5Fw .

David Lim with the story: “The White House has blocked FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn from testifying to a House committee about his agency’s pandemic response, angering the panel's top Democrats who said they have pressing questions about political interference at the agency.  “Hahn briefed members of the committee during a private Aug. 31 teleconference, but there is ‘bipartisan interest’ in holding a public hearing, the Democrats said. A White House spokesperson confirmed that Hahn was blocked from testifying, calling the decision ‘part of the administration’s existing protocol to make sure health officials can keep their time and energy focused on responding to the coronavirus.’ The spokesperson noted Hahn has testified to Congress four times in the past six months, including before Pallone's committee in June.” More: https://politi.co/33JOuQc .

DOWN BALLOT -- Dems aren't going to be shut out of redistricting like they were after the 2010 GOP wave. But under-the-radar elections in key states this fall will determine just how much say they will have on the new maps for 2022. Ally Mutnick with the dispatch: “Far away from the glare of the presidential campaign, a competition rivaling it in importance is playing out across the country: for power over the redistricting process — and potentially control of the House for the next decade.  “Republicans dominated the 2010 elections and used their authority over map-drawing to cement a hold on the House for most of this decade. This time, Democrats are poised to claw back some of that power, and the extent of their gains will come down to under-the-radar elections in a pair of GOP-leaning Sun Belt states: North Carolina and Texas. Both parties are funneling millions into the battle for the Texas state House and the North Carolina legislature, eager to have a greater say in the crafting of what could be as many as 53 congressional districts between the two states combined.” More: https://politi.co/3mH1D55 .

President Donald Trump hasn’t even named a nominee yet, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is quickly closing in on the GOP votes to fill the vacancy at some point this year. Three key Republican holdouts — Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Chuck Grassley of Iowa — all broke their silence yesterday and signaled support for McConnell moving ahead with the confirmation vote.  Now, all eyes are on Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has no loyalty to the president and isn’t up for reelection this year. But he also hails from a religious state and has been a pretty reliable conservative vote for the GOP, other than his vote to convict Trump in the impeachment trial earlier this year. “This is a lot different than impeachment,” cautioned Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “I would be very surprised if Romney doesn’t vote for the nominee.”  But keep in mind: Only two GOP senators have come out in opposition to holding a confirmation vote this year, so that means McConnell can afford to lose Romney, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie. And at this point, it’s unclear where a fourth “no” vote would come from. So far, however, Romney is remaining tight-lipped: “I\\'m not gonna speak about this until I had a chance to speak with my colleagues,” he told reporters.

Learn how Ron and others succeed at McDonald’s.  MEANWHILE … Trump is pushing the GOP to confirm his Supreme Court nominee before the November election, and a handful of Republicans have echoed similar calls. But yesterday, GOP leaders were not committing themselves to a timeline. During a Monday floor speech, McConnell didn’t specify a date for the vote other than “this year,” while GOP senators emerged from a leadership meeting last night equally non-committal.  Yet Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News last night that there’s momentum in the GOP for a quick vote on the yet-to-be-named nominee. \"We\\'ve got the votes to confirm Justice Ginsburg\\'s replacement before the election, we\\'re going to move forward in the committee, we\\'re going to report the nomination out of the committee to the floor of the United States Senate so we can vote before the election,” he said. Graham also pleaded for more campaign cash— a sign of just how much Republicans are being outraised. Watch.  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), however, made clear he has no qualms about filling the vacancy during the lame-duck session of Congress, which would be even more controversial if Trump loses the White House and could raise questions of legitimacy for Trump’s nominee (whom he is expected to announce Saturday). And holding it in the lame-duck could be risky, since McConnell may be working with a slimmer majority if Democrat Mark Kelly wins a special election against Martha McSally in Arizona. All the latest on the state of play from Andrew, Burgess and Marianne: https://politi.co/33RwaVt .  THE GOP, HOWEVER, is still trying to fend off accusations of hypocrisy from Democrats. And Republicans have made a litany of arguments to justify their moves, including: Democrats would have done the same thing if the roles were reversed … When Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, the Senate and White House were controlled by different parties … It’s the GOP’s constitutional duty and the reason they won the majority … and Dems essentially brought it upon themselves with their treatment of Brett Kavanaugh.  Democrats, however, point out that in March 2016 — when Garland was nominated — the GOP argued that voters in the upcoming presidential election should have a say in the process. And now we’re even closer to the election, with early voting already underway. During a floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Republicans “have no right to fill it” and warned that this will “spell the end of the greatest deliberative body.” More from Marianne on the GOP’s SCOTUS defense: https://politi.co/3mBdyBH .

House Democrats unveiled a continuing resolution (CR) Monday that funds the government until Dec. 11, but it excludes the farm bailout money favored by Trump and the GOP. And Democrats are pressing ahead with a floor vote later today, despite opposition from Republicans.  The GOP-controlled Senate can either tack on the farm funding and send it back to the House, pass the Democrats’ bill as is, or pass their own stopgap measure. But time is running out, with current government funding set to run out at midnight on Sept. 30. We still don’t think there will be a shutdown before the election, but this just injects a little last-minute drama into the whole process.

THE MAINE EVENT -- The SCOTUS confirmation battle is poised to roil congressional races up and down the ballot. But that is especially true in Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins was already facing a tough reelection battle after she supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

None of the other 22 Republican senators up for re-election faces as difficult a political moment as Ms. Collins, experts and campaign strategists said, as polls already have shown Ms. Collins consistently behind Democrat Sara Gideon.” More: https://on.wsj.com/2ZXBXYp .

McAllister, a policy official at the trade association CropLife America, urged U.S. agriculture officials to fight any effort to include the words ‘crops’ or ‘fungicides’ in the guidelines — a position that would run counter to growing international consensus that the overuse of antifungal compounds is a threat to human health by contributing to drug resistance and should be monitored. … When the Codex Intergovernmental Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance met in South Korea several months later, the American delegation insisted that the guidelines omit any references to fungicides, a stance that infuriated other participants and forced a monthslong delay in the task force’s work.  — \"The emails, which were written in 2018 and obtained through a lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, offer a behind-the-curtain peek at how the powerful pesticide industry influences policy decisions that can affect billions of people across the globe. In a statement, the U.S.D.A. said the email exchanges were simply part of the agency’s process for crafting its official position. ‘It is the normal course of business for U.S.D.A. to solicit input from industry when developing a technical document in order to understand current practice in the United States,’ the agency wrote.”  MEANWHILE, IN CALIFORNIA: “A state investigation into the country\\'s largest natural gas utility is steadily piecing together details of how the company may have cloaked its advocacy by recruiting local politicians and minority groups to promote fossil fuels at California ports, according to people familiar with the probe and documents obtained by POLITICO,” POLITICO California’s Colby Bermel reports. State utility watchdogs are examining whether Southern California Gas “acted unlawfully in its lobbying efforts as the company fights the state\\'s transition away from oil and gas.”  — “The Public Advocates Office, an independent branch of the California Public Utilities Commission, launched an investigation last year when it found SoCalGas spent ratepayer dollars to start a group opposed to cities phasing out or banning natural gas in new buildings. The company ‘is working to undermine state policy through lobbying and other efforts to misinform the public and encourage the continued usage of natural gas,’ the PAO wrote this summer. The PAO probe has since widened to include other SoCalGas activities, including the company\\'s relationship with Imprenta Communications Group, a public affairs firm focused on issues in minority communities.”  ANNALS OF ELECTION FUNDING: “Facing mounting expenses and with Congress yet to provide more money, election administrators across the country are struggling to meet the extraordinary costs of holding an election amid a pandemic,” The New York Times’ Ken Vogel reports. “With Election Day a little more than five weeks away and early voting underway in some states, many municipalities and states are turning to alternative sources of funding, most notably $300 million in grants from the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.”  — “But now even that money is becoming enmeshed in partisan disputes, with conservative groups opening a legal assault on Thursday to block private grants from going to election administrators in Democratic strongholds in four swing states, arguing they will disproportionately help Democrats like the party’s presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. … Erick G. Kaardal, a lawyer affiliated with the Thomas More Society, a conservative nonprofit legal group that has been aligned with the Trump administration, predicted Mr. Zuckerberg’s grants would set a bad precedent.” The Thomas More Society said it filed lawsuits in federal court on Thursday against localities that received nearly $26 million from one of the groups to which Zuckerberg gave, the Center for Tech and Civic Life.

POLITICO Pro is a policy intelligence platform that combines the news you need with tools you can use to take action on the day’s biggest stories. Act on the news with POLITICO Pro.  Quick Fix  Last week, and six months into the coronavirus pandemic, the federal worker safety agency issued its first Covid-19-related citations in the meatpacking industry, where the United Food and Commercial Workers estimated that more than 18,000 workers have been exposed to the virus. But the union, which represents meatpacking workers, said the citations issued against a Smithfield plant in South Dakota and a plant owned by JBS Foods in Colorado are a “new low” for the Trump administration.  Together, the fines against the two companies totaled roughly $29,000, despite a combined total of at least 12 worker deaths and almost 1,500 infections due to outbreaks at both plants, according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the UFCW.  Employees of two departments at the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, S.D. report to work on May 4, 2020. | AP Photo/Stephen Groves  With the fines, OSHA and the Department of Labor “prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not care about holding irresponsible corporations accountable for the lives lost or worker safety,” UFCW President Marc Perrone said in a statement.  Former OSHA officials say the agency could have charged more. “OSHA went VERY VERY easy on Smithfield,” tweeted Dr. David Michaels, head of OSHA during the Obama administration. He said the agency “could have issued numerous citations” one for each of the areas the agency found the company failed to protect workers. He added that “if OSHA asserted they were willful, the penalty could be 10X as high.” (OSHA’s maximum fine for a “willful” citation is $134,937.)  For its part, the Trump administration has declined to issue mandatory safety rules during the pandemic, instead offering optional guidelines, which it maintains are sufficient to shield workers from the coronavirus. “OSHA has meatpacking industry guidance and other resources to assist in worker protection,” said OSHA Denver Area Director Amanda Kupper in a statement in the citation issued to JBS Foods.  But federal OSHA officials recently admitted during proceedings in a lawsuit filed by workers at a Maid-Rite Specialty Foods plant in Pennsylvania that the guidelines require nothing of factory managers. Although OSHA inspectors witnessed employees working “2 to 3 feet” apart without physical barriers — which goes against the Centers for Disease Control’s advice and OSHA’s safety recommendations — the agency concluded there was no “imminent danger” at the plant that needed to be immediately addressed by the company. OSHA said that its work isn’t done at the Maid-Rite Specialty plant and that it has six months to issue a citation.  Because OSHA hasn’t issued Covid-19-specific safety regulations, as Democrats and unions have called for, the agency could only cite Smithfield and JBS under a provision in the 1970 statute that created OSHA called the “general duty clause.” The provision requires businesses to maintain “a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees.  OSHA has rarely used the general duty clause in enforcement — in part because it’s a cumbersome legal tool that requires review from the higher ranks at the agency, which can take time. The provision also has a four-part legal test that makes it vulnerable to court challenge. (More on that here.) Both Smithfield and JBS have 15 business days to contest the citations.  GOOD MORNING.

REFRESHER: Under that relief package, certain employers were required to give workers who are quarantined or experiencing Covid-19 symptoms two weeks' paid sick leave, and grant an additional 10 weeks' leave to workers who are caring for children stuck at home.  The revision comes after a federal judge invalidated parts of the DOL’s original rule in August, finding that the agency’s interpretation of the health care worker exemption was “vastly overbroad” and left out workers “whose roles bear no nexus whatsoever to the provision of healthcare services.”  WHAT’S NEW? In a temporary rule that will be published in the Federal Register Wednesday, the DOL clarifies that health care providers are employees who “provide diagnostic services, preventive services, treatment services, or other services that are integrated with and necessary to the provision of patient care.”  The DOL also reaffirmed a provision of its original rule that allows employers to withhold paid leave if they have no work for employees to perform and a requirement that workers must seek permission from their employer to take intermittent leave. Both of these sections of the original rule were invalidated under the August court order, but DOL is now providing more explanation of the legal basis for those provisions.  On the Hill  PREGNANT WORKER PROTECTIONS BILL TO HIT HOUSE FLOOR: The House Rules committee will meet at 1 p.m. to prepare H.R. 2694 (116), The Pregnant Workers’ Fairness Act, for floor debate, readying it for a full House vote this week. The legislation would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help pregnant workers continue working and would also bar employers from denying employment opportunities to them because they are pregnant.  In the States  CABBIES POISED FOR REBOUND IN AB 5 FIGHT: If Uber and Lyft pull out of the Golden State over California’s Assembly Bill 5, taxi drivers “are eager to let the public know that they are ready to take up the slack,” Carolyn Said reports for the San Francisco Chronicle.  “Taxis have already matched some Uber and Lyft features,” Said writes, “such as apps for summoning vehicles, on top of phone dispatch and street hails, neither of which are available from the ride-hailing companies.” The threat of the ride-hailing apps leaving California has even helped business, Hansu Kim, owner of a taxi company based in San Francisco, told the Chronicle. He said he’s received inquiries “from companies that wanted to open corporate accounts.”  BACKGROUND: “The two ride-hailing companies threatened to temporarily cease service in California because of a preliminary injunction in a court case seeking to force them to reclassify drivers as employees. They won a temporary reprieve, but it’s unknown how they’ll react if Proposition 22, a ballot measure they are backing that would permanently keep drivers as independent contractors, does not pass in November.”  Immigration  ICE DEPORTATION ARRESTS RESUME: A nationwide immigration enforcement operation was announced this month, “the first large-scale arrests and deportations in the interior of the country since the coronavirus pandemic halted field operations for several months,” Miriam Jordan reports for The New York Times. “Since mid-July, immigration agents have taken more than 2,000 people into custody from their homes, workplaces and other sites, including a post office, often after staking them out for days.”  WHO WAS TARGETED? About 85 percent of those caught in the sweep “either had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges,” Jordan reports. “But analysis of the totality of the government’s own data shows that the administration is arresting large numbers of undocumented immigrants whose crimes are minor, or who have not committed any crime at all.”  WHY? As Jordan explains: “These immigrants are easier to locate and remove precisely because they are not trying to evade law enforcement, even if they have outstanding deportation orders.”  2020 Watch  BIDEN COURTS BLACK FARMERS: “The Biden campaign has spent the summer criticizing discrimination in agriculture, organizing roundtable discussions and tapping former Black government officials in an aggressive push to attract Black farmers, a small but potentially significant slice of the rural vote,” our Ximena Bustillo reports. “Farmers of color, numbering more than 260,000 nationally, make up between 10 and 65 percent of farmers in almost a dozen states, including swing states of Arizona, Florida and Nevada.”  “Black farmers have long struggled to get equal access to USDA programs that help build credit and address civil rights complaints,” Ximena writes. “They have pushed the government for more enforcement to retain land that has been in their families for generations at a time when farmers, generally, are facing unprecedented economic headwinds due to the pandemic and trade war disruptions. The Biden campaign has released a plan to work with nonwhite farmers to tackle these issues.”  What We're Reading  — “From a stable job to a tent: A waiter’s homeless struggle,” from The Associated Press  — “The Maitre d’ Will Take Your Temperature Now,” from The New York Times  — ICYMI: “ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the planes could transport agents to D.C. protests.

Gavin Newsom? If you’re thinking, “yes,” then you may be either a masochist or the mayor of San Diego.  California governors regularly have to navigate deficits and disasters — but the cascading crises of Newsom’s administration have set a new bar. Ask former Gov. Gray Davis, who has some experience with tenure-derailing cataclysms.  “Most governors will experience some form of crisis,” he told us. “Either a substantial recession, wildfires, earthquakes — that comes with the territory. But I think Gov. Newsom clearly wins the prize for having to cope with the most crises at the same time.”  Gov. Gavin Newsom holds his son Dutch while speaking during his inauguration Monday, Jan. 7, 2019, in Sacramento, Calif. | AP Photo/Eric Risberg  Remember Newsom’s triumphant inauguration in January of 2019? A humming economy was fueling a budget surplus and the telegenic new governor — with a nationally covered assist from his adorably intrepid toddler — was pitching California as a progressive lodestar and the counterweight to Trumpism. Weeks later, PG&E declared bankruptcy, setting off a fight that would overshadow Newsom’s first year.  California’s intensifying homelessness crisis was supposed to be the focus of 2020, with Newsom dedicating most of his second State of the State speech to the issue — and then the coronavirus overtook everything (and separately, those vaunted housing production goals collided with political reality). Blackouts, catastrophic wildfires, a president who relishes targeting California and yet whose help Newsom must seek — you name it. POLITICO’s Debra Kahn, Alexander Nieves and Jeremy B. White dug into why Newsom has one of the hardest political gigs in America. It’s our latest feature for The Fifty, a POLITICO series that covers the outsize role governors and mayors are playing in America today.  Despite all those headwinds, Newsom’s constituents are still largely with him. Per the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll, both likely voters and all adults give Newsom sturdy approval ratings of around 60 percent for his governorship in general and his coronavirus handling specifically — markedly better ratings than the Legislature draws, and inversions of President Donald Trump’s continually abysmal California numbers.  But plenty of political peril still looms between Newsom and another term — or beyond. Lockdown fatigue and the prolonged pain of businesses struggling to stay afloat are fueling angst, as is the state’s universally panned unemployment system. Severe housing and homelessness issues that preceded the pandemic could be exacerbated by its economic ravages, as could the state’s nation-leading poverty rate. So, like we said: Do you really want his job?  BUENOS DÍAS, good Wednesday morning. Attorney General Xavier Becerra is testifying to Congress today about California’s new data privacy law, which the California Department of Justice enforces on California businesses. He’ll address the Senate Commerce Committee starting at 7 a.m. PST.  QUOTE OF THE DAY: “To this day we have a Commander in Chief of the United States of America who is holding rallies with no masks, because, you see, he has convinced everyone that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask and you’re on the other side if you don’t. Making value judgments about people who are concerned with not dying.” Sen. Kamala Harris at a Detroit campaign event, on the day America surpassed 200,000 coronavirus deaths (some 15,000 in California).  TWEET OF THE DAY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez @AOC joins a progressive Feinstein pile-on: “Sen. Feinstein’s protection of the filibuster is unjust & unacceptable. The filibuster wasn’t made w/ purpose. It‘s the result of an accident in rulebook revision & bloomed as a cherished tool of segregationists. Now it empowers minority rule. That’s not ‘special,’ it’s unjust.”  WHERE’S GAVIN?

County sheriff, alleging ‘cover-up’ of Kobe Bryant crash photos,” by the LA Times’ Richard Winton: “[Sheriff Alex] Villanueva has admitted that eight deputies were involved in taking and sharing photos of the remains of Kobe Bryant and other victims at the scene of the crash in Calabasas and that he ordered the photos to be destroyed. He said at least one of the photos was shared outside of the department.”  FIRE AND ICE — ”He fought wildfires while imprisoned.

THE FIFTY: Governors and mayors have never mattered more to the future of the nation, and The Fifty, a new series from POLITICO, takes you inside the role they’re playing in the pandemic and more.  THE TRUMP ERA  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — FORD’S FIGHT: Ford Motor Co. is leaning in to a California-centric fight over vehicle emissions, launching a new statewide ad campaign emphasizing that the automaker is sticking with California’s tougher standards rather than the more relaxed framework advanced by the Trump administration. The divergent rules have both sharpened differences between California and D.C. and divided the industry — and Ford’s new spot calls out rivals Chevrolet, Jeep and Toyota for siding with the Trump administration. The campaign also entails a new website.  GIG CLASH — “DOL releases proposal on gig worker classification under minimum wage, OT law,” by POLITICO’s Rebecca Rainey: “The rulemaking will be closely watched by app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, as their workers are generally classified as independent contractors. Those companies are currently battling a new law in California that would make most of their drivers employees, warning that the change would upend their business model.”  — THE KEY CA LINE: “The Department believes adopting the ABC test” — the standard set out by the California Supreme Court and advanced by AB 5 — “as the [The Fair Labor Standards Act’s] generally applicable standard for distinguishing employees from independent contractors would be unduly restrictive and disruptive to the economy,” the feds wrote.  KAMALA CRED — “GOP senators who play with fire with the Supreme Court will get scorched,” opines the WaPo’s Jennifer Rubin: “The Democratic nominee for vice president, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), sits on the Judiciary Committee. Do Republicans really want to give the whip-smart, telegenic senator potentially hours of live TV coverage — watch Democrats give her their time so she can rake the nominee over the coals — during which she makes clear just how extreme Trump’s nominee is?”  — “Maxine Waters tells Powell Fed’s emergency actions have ‘fallen badly short’,” by POLITICO’s Victoria Guida.

Meanwhile, the DCCC is on TV in CA-25 attacking Rep. Mike Garcia’s pandemic voting record and in CA-48 accusing Orange County Supervisor Michelle Steel of corruption.

POLITICO’S CALIFORNIA BALLOT TRACKER: No state does ballot initiatives quite like California, and interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to sway voters. It’s all here in POLITICO’s guide to California’s 2020 ballot initiatives.  CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR  ADMISSIONS SCANDAL FALLOUT — “California auditor: 64 UC students admitted through unfair influence in recent years,” by POLITICO’s Mackenzie Hawkins: “The review came after last year\\'s college admissions bribery scandal implicated a UCLA soccer coach among other officials at a host of prestigious schools across the country. State lawmakers ordered the audit to determine if UC officials were admitting unqualified students due to influential connections.”  — “The dungeon master,” by the Sacramento News & Review’s Raheem Hosseini: “Jail deaths climbed to their highest number last year under Sheriff Scott Jones—a fact the three-term lawman largely withheld from the media.”  — “Inside The Chaos of Immigration Court,” by Gabriel Thompson for Longreads: “The court, especially under Trump, is a battlefield on which the rules are constantly shifting. At the front line of that battle, two conflicting imperatives meet. The first is Constitutional: the right to due process — for an immigrant to receive a full hearing in front of an impartial judge. The second is political: Trump wants to deport asylum seekers quickly.”  — “Climate Disruption Is Now Locked In. The Next Moves Will Be Crucial.,” by the NYT’s John Branch and Brad Plumer: “One hope raised by some experts is that the current onslaught of fires and storms — the death, the destruction, the apocalyptic skies — might motivate people to unite behind calls for action. ‘Those orange skies — I mean, that was scary,’ said Kris May, a climate scientist and coastal engineer in San Francisco.”  — “California Republican lawmaker said his party asked for state pay cuts. It didn’t,” by the Sac Bee’s Wes Venteicher.  — “She tried to rent motel rooms for homeless people. A NIMBY hospital stopped her,” by the LA Times’ Erika D. Smith: “What has gone down in Kern County this year, culminating in a particularly dispiriting Bakersfield City Council meeting this month, is so ridiculous on its face that it’s almost laughable. But it’s serious business that, to a lesser degree, has been replicated all over the state.”  A message from The Great Courses Plus:  SILICON VALLEYLAND  — “Justice Department, states to meet in possible prelude to Google antitrust suit,” by POLITICO’s Leah Nylen: “Once the Justice Department finishes its complaint against Google, state attorneys general will have a deadline to decide whether they want to join the Justice Department in what could become one of the biggest U.S. antitrust battles in decades.”  — “Tesla’s latest big unveil isn’t a car or truck: It’s the battery tech that could power its future,” by WaPo’s Faiz Siddiqui: “It’s the latest innovation push by the Silicon Valley car builder that has aimed to rewrite the rules on electric vehicles, making them performance-oriented and aspirational in a way that has eluded competitors.”  — “Facebook vows to restrict users if US election descends into chaos,” by the Financial Times’ Hannah Murphy: “Facebook refused to go into detail over its plans for election-related content control, as malicious actors might use that information to proactively work out how to game the system. However, during previous periods of unrest in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the company took action including reducing the reach of content shared by repeated rule-breakers, and limiting the distribution of ‘borderline content’ that was sensationalist but did not quite breach its hate speech rules. “  HOLLYWOODLAND  — “‘Amazon Room’ Becomes Hot Amenity for Hollywood Homebuyers Amid Pandemic,” by The Hollywood Reporter’s Hadley Meares: “In a COVID-19 world, buyers are looking for a room to store the many packages that arrive, and also a spot for them to decontaminate before opening.”  MIXTAPE  — “Flu shots in the Bay Area: where to get yours, and why they’re important during pandemic,” by the SF Chronicle’s Annie Vashstein.  — “A family called 911 for son’s mental health crisis.

Last week, a “mislabeled” bin containing 1,666 uncounted mail-in ballots from the July 7 primary was found at the Sussex County Board of Elections.  The ballots were counted on Saturday and miraculously did not affect the long-certified results of the election.  But when it comes to questions about the primarily mail-in election to be held in November, this isn’t a point in the governor’s favor. Nearly 1,700 ballots could easily help decide a local race or even a congressional race. And based on historical trends, voter turnout for the general election is going to be well over twice the primary.  Read more about it here .

WHAT TRENTON MADE    BILL TEXT TO BE READ BY MICROMACHINES GUY — McKeon says stock exchanges should enage on micro-cent tax proposal, by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: McKeon says that while these warehouses are paying things like property taxes, they are not employing many people, and so the impact wouldn’t be that great. Jared Walczak, who has studied this tax at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, agreed that these centers are not “employment heavy,” but said they are high paying jobs. New Jersey companies that do business with the data centers could also lose out, Walczak said. Walczak, who serves as the vice president of state projects, said the idea of taxing these transactions is a complex one. The actual trading floors are in New York, whereas the only activity happening in New Jersey is the digital processing of the transaction. Since the stock exchanges have servers elsewhere, it would be relatively “simple” for them to process transactions somewhere else, he said.  MCKNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR — Lawmaker to introduce new bill granting subpoena power to police review boards, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Assemblymember Angela McKnight plans to introduce a new version of a bill that would allow civilian complaint review boards to subpoena records and investigate police officer misconduct concurrently with internal affairs units. The bill would also appropriate $600,000 for the Attorney General’s office to develop a training program for county or municipal review board members. Board members would be required to complete training prior to investigating officers or departments, according to a copy of the legislation provided to POLITICO. “To watch the killing of George Floyd nationally, so many people saw it, and then to read about the killing of Breonna Taylor, it did shine the light brightly [on police violence],” McKnight (D-Hudson) said in an interview late Monday afternoon. “Things happen for a reason ... and I pray for their families, but they’re not going to die in vain.”  FUNDS TO BE USED TO RENOVATE STATEHOUSE AFTER CHRISTIE’S RENOVATION IF MURPHY DOESN’T LIKE IT — “New Details on NJ borrowing plan as fight looms over tax estimates,” by NJ Spotlight’s John Reitmeyer: “According to budget documents and recent testimony during hearings before lawmakers, Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration is planning to use a 10-year repayment schedule for a total of $4 billion in new debt to help fund a nine-month budget he put forward last month. Annual interest on the bonds could be around 2%, and repayment would begin almost immediately at a cost of about $400 million annually in a full budget year, Department of Treasury officials told lawmakers last week. They also made a commitment to refrain from back-loading debt or using balloon payments, something that prior administrations have done to reduce short-term pain, even when it has driven up the total cost for future generations … The new details about the proposed borrowing suggest the Murphy administration is taking a restrained approach, at least initially ... But there are brewing concerns that the final decisions on borrowing will be made entirely behind closed doors”  —“NJ budget: Taxes, more debt, ballooning pensions and more undesirable choices on the table”  NO EVIDENCE OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION EITHER — “No evidence of in-classroom transmission as number of COVID-19 cases at N.J. schools rises, state says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Kelly Heyboer: “Though at least six New Jersey school districts have reported positive COVID-19 cases in the first two weeks of in-person classes, none of those cases are believed to be incidents where students or teachers caught the coronavirus in the classroom, state officials said Monday. Schools in Howell, Frankford, Little Silver, Chatham and Washington Township in Gloucester County and a county vocational school in East Brunswick have all switched to remote learning or asked some students to stay home due to positive COVID-19 cases. It is believed the students and teachers who tested positive all got the coronavirus outside of school and no one they came into contact with in the classroom has contracted COVID-19, Gov. Phil Murphy said at his coronavirus press briefing.”  —“Persichilli: NJ could have stopped COVID-19 sooner with Trump info”  —Persichilli: Federal funds can help offset proposed cuts to hospital charity care  —New Jersey to launch contact tracing pilot program on college campuses using digital app  IMMIGRATION — “’We’re just trying to survive.’ N.J.\\'s undocumented workers left out of coronavirus relief rally for aid,” by NJ Advance Medai’s Sophie Nieto-Munoz: “Six months ago, as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut down, companies started laying off and furloughing workers. In the months since, some of the state’s 9 million residents received a $1,200 stimulus check, applied for expanded unemployment benefits, and sought opportunities for aid through the federal Paycheck Protection Program or small business loans. But more than 722,000 residents who are not documented were left out of pandemic relief due to citizenship status, according to a new study released Monday by Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant advocacy group that works closely with the Latino community.”  DANNY DEVITO URGED NOT TO INVITE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER TO N.J.— “N.J. preparing for ‘twin-demic’ with flu season piling on coronavirus outbreak, top health official says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Matt Arco: “New Jersey residents should get flu vaccinations as soon as possible to avoid a potential ‘twin-demic’ that could stress the state’s healthcare system if there’s also a spike in the coronavirus pandemic, the state’s top health official said Monday. “As we enter the fall season, we are also moving into the flu season.

But state emergency management officials say New Jersey school districts will be covered with a shipment of 2.4 million masks from the federal government. “As many students and teachers across our state and our country head back to school, FEMA’s policy will likely make it harder for state and local governments. This will hamstring efforts to slow the spread of the virus and prolong this pandemic,” a bipartisan group of New Jersey Congress members wrote in a letter to Peter Gaynor, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Eleven of the 12 members of New Jersey’s House delegation signed the letter. Only Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew did not.  KNIGHTS OF ROUND TABLE KNOW AN ARTHURIAN WHEN THEY SEE ONE — “I know an authoritarian when I see one,” by Bob Menendez for Univision: “In my 28 years in Congress, I have fought for democracy, freedom and human rights and against dictatorships around the globe—from China, to Cuba’s communist regime, to Maduro\\'s socialist catastrophe. My family has lived under dictators in Cuba. I know an authoritarian when I see one. When the President of the United States calls the free press the enemy of the people, I hear the words of dictators. When the President sends in troops to silence peaceful protestors, as he did outside the White House for a photo op, I see the Castros who routinely use state forces against political dissidents.”  —“U.S. Chamber Of Commerce Endorses Kean For Congress”      A message from Masterworks:      LOCAL    HOW MUCH MORE PPE COULD THE DISTRICT BUY WITH INZELBUCH’S $600K SALARY? — “Lakewood schools: Board lawyer Inzelbuch takes spotlight; teachers chafe over \\'dangerous actions,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Gustavo Martinez Contreras: “It\\'s the start of another school year in Lakewood and Michael Inzelbuch is out front again. Literally. The Board of Education attorney was outside the middle school chasing after the teachers\\' union president as reporters sought to conduct on-camera interviews. When Kimberlee Shaw, Lakewood Education Association president, turned left, so did Inzelbuch. When Shaw turned right, Inzelbuch followed, like a duckling chasing its mother. He butted in again and again, seizing the spotlight. The interviews were a bust. ‘You (Shaw) don\\'t do nothing for Lakewood. Let\\'s meet,’ Inzelbuch interjected. Inzelbuch\\'s outsize role in directing the 6,500-student district has long attracted attention from union leaders, politicians and watchdog groups, but he is even more prominent than usual, with the pandemic swirling in the background and Lakewood attempting to offer what few New Jersey districts are: a nearly normal school experience.”  NEXT YOU’LL TELL ME STUDENTS WHO DON’T GO TO CLASS WON’T PASS — “Paterson schools dock pay of 450 employees in COVID-19 dispute, teacher\\'s union says,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “About 450 Paterson educators who didn\\'t report to their schools for an in-person class preparation day on Sept. 1 will find their paychecks a little short on Tuesday, according to the city teachers\\' union. Superintendent Eileen Shafer is carrying out her warning that employees who didn\\'t come to work would be docked for the preparation day, despite the union’s assertions that the district failed to provide sufficient health protection for staffers amid the COVID-19 crisis. The union argued the school lacked proper ventilation and sufficient plexiglass partitions. But the district has maintained that sufficient safeguards were in place.”  TRAIN TO MANASQUAN — “Asbury Park Zombie Walk virtual in 2020, cancels in-person gathering,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Alex Biese: “The Asbury Park Zombie Walk, an annual tradition for more than a decade historically held on the first Saturday of October, will not hold a in-person gather in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, event organizers announced on Monday. \\'It seems like the ultimate irony that an actual viral pandemic is keeping our zombies from converging on the Boardwalk this October, but it is with the health and safety of every one of you in mind that we cannot host the Zombie Walk in Asbury Park this year,\\' event founder Jason Meehan said in a statement Monday morning.”  WHEN THEY DROP THE PRETENSE OF SUPPORTING LEGAL IMMIGRANTS—“Jersey City to join NYC in court fight to oppose increase for immigration fees,” by Hudson County View’s John Heinis: “Jersey City is poised to join New York City in a court fight to oppose immigration fees such as an increase for U.S. citizenship applications, with fees projected to jump from $725 to about $1,200 on this side of the Hudson River, according to Mayor Steven Fulop … On September 2nd, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a policy alert that indicated they had published a new fee schedule, along with changes to other immigrant benefit requests on August 3rd, and that the new fees would go into effect on October 2nd.”  —“OSHA official, brother, caught on recording after soliciting bribe from North Bergen contractor”  —“NJ teacher files defamation lawsuit over Facebook posts mistaking her identity with child sex offender”  —“Lawsuits accuse Englewood police of harassment, racial bias against non-Black officers”  —“Some N.J. teachers were denied work-from-home requests.

The earthquake that hit Los Angeles hours later felt like divine punctuation.  There were glowing tributes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s towering legacy.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: “Every woman and girl, and therefore every family, in America has benefited from her brilliance.”  Rep. Katie Porter: “I’m thinking today about Justice Ginsburg’s remark that there will be enough women on the Supreme Court when there are nine.”  Rep. Jackie Speier: “We have lost an American Icon of untold proportions, a feminist with the steeliest spine, and a jurist of remarkable talent, legal precision, and a yearning for justice for all.”  Gov. Gavin Newsom: “Our hearts ache tonight. Let us honor her memory by preserving the very ideals she fought so tirelessly for.”  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi arrives to pay her respects at the makeshift memorial for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in front of the Supreme Court on September 20, 2020. | Samuel Corum/Getty Images  Even California Republicans praised her fortitude. But other, more visceral reactions of the “NOOOOO” variety underscored the enormous political repercussions. We saw more than a few calls for Democrats to pack the court if they reclaim Congress.  And plenty of Democrats framed this as a call to action: “We must pick up the pieces and pick up the fight,” urged former Sen. Barbara Boxer. “Cry. Scream. Have a meltdown. Then get into warrior mode,” advised Planned Parenthood’s Jodi Hicks.  At stake long-term are a suite of policies cherished by California Democrats, preeminently Obamacare — which state Attorney General Xavier Becerra is fighting to preserve in court. Rep. Adam Schiff said on Sunday that “our health is on the ballot,” echoing a top-down party focus on that issue.  But the ripples are far wider. California voters could reinstate affirmative action in November by passing Proposition 16; a solidly conservative court could invalidate such diversity-boosting measures. Gun control, abortion rights — the list goes on. “HEY 2020, WE DON’T NEED A REMINDER HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE,” Newsom administration official Jason Elliott wrote.  KAMALA’S ROLE: Perhaps more than any California politician, Sen. Kamala Harris will be in the thick of what comes next. She’ll be hammering the SCOTUS vacancy as a presidential ticket member.  “The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher,” she said on Twitter. “Millions of Americans are counting on us to win and protect the Supreme Court—for their health, for their families, and for their rights.” The Biden-Harris ticket shattered fundraising records in the hours after Ginsburg’s death was announced. “Today,” announced a Harris fundraising email, “we fight for her legacy.”  And as you may remember, Harris sits on a certain committee with jurisdiction over court appointments. Her prosecutorial grilling of Senate Judiciary witnesses vaulted her into the national consciousness, playing no small role in her presidential prevalence — and so it’s something of a full-circle moment that a fight redefining the presidential race will put Harris in the brightest Senate spotlight. She’ll be joined by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s infamous blocking of nominee Merrick Garland in saying, “Under no circumstances should the Senate consider a replacement for Justice Ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration.”  Newsom doesn’t get a vote, but he was excoriating Republicans on that point: “Mitch McConnell. 2016. Never forget,” he tweeted, citing the Garland incident. He quoted Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Lindsey Graham as having staked out similar positions, telling his followers that this is “the only time in my life I have ever recommend[ed] that we do what Lindsey Graham says: USE HIS WORDS AGAINST HIM.” And a Newsom fundraising missive urged donors to channel money to Senate Democrats: “The most important thing we can do right now is to elect a Democratic Senate Majority that will appoint a Supreme Court Justice who believes in equality and the rule of law.”  BUENOS DÍAS, good Monday morning. Former Gov. Jerry Brown is buoying the Biden-Harris campaign today, joining a climate roundtable hosted by the Nevada State Democratic Party that will focus on how a Biden administration would differ on climate from the Trump administration.  QUOTE OF THE DAY: “There cannot be one set of rules for a Republican President and one set for a Democratic President, and considering a nominee before the next inauguration would be wholly inappropriate. We urge you to adhere to your own words and commit publicly that you will not consider any nominee to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat until after the next President is inaugurated.” Senate Judiciary Democrats, led by Feinstein, make their plea in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chair Graham.  TWEET OF THE DAY: Newsom chief of staff @Ann_OLeary posts an impassioned RBG thread: “While I am not radical, I am ready to fly to DC in the middle of COVID19 and lay my body on the floor of the United States Senate to prevent a vote from occurring before the next term of Congress.”  BONUS TOTD: WSJ reporter Christine Mai-Duc @cmaiduc: “Welp I just screamed ‘2020 IS THE WORST YEAR EVER’ and my husband had to remind me our daughters were, in fact, born this year”  WHERE’S GAVIN? #NewsomAtNoon — Gov. Gavin Newsom will provide an update on the state’s response to the wildfires and Covid-19 pandemic. The update will be streamed at the @CAgovernor Twitter page and California Governor Facebook page.

Consider who owns the building. The lobby features signs for Vornado Realty Trust, the publicly traded firm, with innumerable shareholders, that has a 70% stake in the tower. The other 30% belongs to a single man: Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States.”  — ”Graduate student who claimed to be Black loses faculty job offer at Fresno State,” by the LA Times’ Nina Agrawal.  CALIFORNIA ON FIRE  GETTING WORSE — \"California fire activity ‘slowly picking up again,’ air quality worsens,\" by the SF Chronicle\\'s Shwanika Narayan.  — ”Damage from wildfires’ toxic air lingers long after the smoke clears,” by the LA Times’ Katheryn Houghton: “So far, researchers have seen that people’s lung capacity declined in the first two years after the smoke cleared.”  — ”Firefighter killed battling wildfire, bringing California death toll to 26,” by the LA Times’ Hayley Smith and Rong-Gong Lin.  — \"Ignoring fire evacuation orders is rampant in California.

Pandemic creates rare gap year,” by POLITICO’s Mackenzie Mays: “Parents across the nation are skipping kindergarten in droves during the most tumultuous school year in generations. Frustrated by the thought of sticking their 5-year-olds in front of screens during the pivotal first year of school, they are sending their children to extended preschool, forming learning pods or foregoing formal instruction altogether.”  — “‘Tsunami’ of hotel closures is coming, experts warn,” by the LA Times’ Hugo Martín.  — ”Indoor dining might resume by month’s end in SF. Will it be enough to save struggling restaurants?” by the SF Chronicle’s Michael Cabanatuan, Nora Mishanec and Janelle Bitker.  — \"‘We shouldn’t be shut out of church’: Large Catholic demonstration in S.F. demands reopening,\" by the SF Chronicle\\'s Rusty Simmons.  THE FIFTY: Governors and mayors have never mattered more to the future of the nation, and The Fifty, a new series from POLITICO, takes you inside the role they’re playing in the pandemic and more.  THE TRUMP ERA  — “Pelosi: No one has ‘any interest’ in government shutdown,” by POLITICO’s Aubree Eliza Weaver: “With just weeks until government funding runs out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated Sunday morning that she has no interest in allowing the government to shut down — not even as a bargaining chip in slowing down President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nomination.”  TIKTOK BAN — “What Commerce’s WeChat-TikTok announcement really means,” by Protocol’s Issie Lapowsky: “The Commerce Department\\'s notice clarifies those orders, specifying that WeChat will also be prohibited from using U.S. internet hosting or content delivery network services beginning Sunday.

PRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT  TRUMP ON KAMALA — “Trump says a Harris vice presidency is ‘no way for a woman’ to become president,” by POLITICO’s Matthew Choi: “‘And if a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it can’t be her. That would rip our country apart.’”  — “Alphabet chairman among tech execs endorsing Joe Biden, citing immigration policies,” by CNBC’s Jennifer Elias.  — \"Biden Likely to Tap Kamala Harris to Prosecute Trump Court Pick,\" by Bloomberg\\'s Jeffrey Taylor and Tyler Pager.  CAMPAIGN MODE  LA TIMES ON SPLIT ROLL — “Yes on Proposition 15. It’s one small step toward fixing California’s broken tax system,” via the LA Times editorial board.  — “California Republicans are stuck with an unpopular Trump. Can they create distance?” by the SF Chronicle’s John Wildermuth: “In a state where Trump is wildly unpopular, Valadao and other GOP congressional candidates are being forced to try not to alienate the president and party faithful who view any disagreement as disloyalty, while still appealing to host of never-Trumpers whose votes they need.”  COX CLASH — “California Democrat says political attack ads accusing him of unpaid taxes \\'are lies\\',” by the Washington Examiner’s Kerry Picket.  POLITICO’S CALIFORNIA BALLOT TRACKER: No state does ballot initiatives quite like California, and interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to sway voters. It’s all here in POLITICO’s guide to California’s 2020 ballot initiatives.  GAVINLAND  IMMIGRANT AID — “Newsom signs law to give more undocumented Californians a tax break worth hundreds of dollars,” by the Sac Bee’s Kim Bojórquez.  — ”Newsom held back from attacking Trump directly on climate change. Here’s why,” by the SF Chronicle’s Alexei Kossef: “That toned-down message reflects the delicate approach the governor has crafted for dealing with Trump, a political rival who also approves — or can block — spending for emergency firefighting resources and recovery aid the state needs.”  A message from The Great Courses Plus:  CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR  EDD ISSUES — “California\\'s embattled UI agency will take 2-week \\'reset,\\' won\\'t resolve backlog until January,” by POLITICO’s Katy Murphy: “The report underscores just how outdated the agency\\'s systems and processes are; one recommendation is to allow people to upload documents from their computers or phones when further documentation or clarification is required, rather than by regular mail.”  — “California job growth is sluggish — and experts say it may get worse,” by the LA Times’ Margot Roosevelt: “California’s job market improved slightly in August, but the state has regained just a third of the jobs it lost since the COVID-19 pandemic forced thousands of businesses to close.”  SANTA CLARA SCANDAL — “How a really big check unraveled a well-oiled patronage system with Santa Clara County concealed-gun permits,” by the East Bay Times’ Robert Salonga: “With prosecution getting underway for adviser and longtime political backer of Sheriff Laurie Smith, grand jury transcripts hint that corruption probe poses biggest political threat yet to sheriff’s two-decade tenure.”  — ”SF census workers say they were told the counting was done. But the city tally is far from complete,” by the SF Chronicle’s Heather Knight: “Months of delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a chaotic, slipshod training in early August, a short time of poorly organized counting and then an abrupt cutoff of their work.”  SILICON VALLEYLAND  — ”The new startup pitch: We’re not Uber,” by the SF Chronicle’s Carolyn Said.

A coronavirus aid deal isn’t coming, Speaker Nancy Pelosi conceded Thursday. House Democrats couldn’t surmount their impasse with the White House after Pelosi’s negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored the substantial daylight between both sides. The House passed Democrats’ $2.2 trillion plan on a largely symbolic and party-line vote last night, but members will head back to their districts without a deal to tout to voters they’re telling to reelect them, as POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris, Melanie Zanona and Heather Caygle report.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to reporters in the House Visitors Center at the U.S. Capitol on October 01, 2020. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  That forces California into the kind of fiscal pain this year’s budget hoped to avoid. The deal Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders struck delayed some $11 billion worth of reductions and deferrals, making those cutbacks contingent on getting federal aid by Oct. 15. It now looks exceedingly unlikely those funds will arrive in California’s accounts in two weeks. POLITICO’s Katy Murphy has detailed how that would hit courts, higher education, state workers and others.  While Newsom has publicly projected optimism about reinforcements arriving, many California Democrats are resigned to waiting for a new president. When you see California Democrats campaigning and raising money for Joe Biden, remember that it isn’t just about the Supreme Court or health care or the environment. It also involves a basic dollars-and-cents calculus. In this view, stabilizing California’s economy — and forestalling an avalanche of evictions and foreclosures next year — depends to a great extent on who’s in the White House.  BUENOS DÍAS, good Friday morning. BREAKING LAST NIGHT: President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We will get through this TOGETHER!“ In other coronavirus news, an appeals panel on Thursday declined to halt California’s pandemic-related restrictions on religious gatherings. While the U.S. Supreme Court has already backed Newsom on this issue in May, that was a 5-4 ruling — and a Justice Amy Coney Barrett could tip the balance if this goes back to SCOTUS.

TOP TALKERS  THEY’RE NUMBER TWO! — “California Republicans reclaim second-place status from independents,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White: “Still, the party has lots of work to do. There are still fewer registered Republicans than there were between 2000 and 2012, although the party is rebounding from its 2016 nadir. … Democrats saw the largest overall gains since last cycle, adding some 1.6 million registered voters. Their edge over Republicans increased by some 1.3 million voters between 2016 and 2020.  “And the numbers could indicate a negative development for Republicans: more no-party-preference voters registering as Democrats. While Republican\\'s share of the electorate remained stable from 2018 to 2020, Democrats expanded their share as the proportion of party-less voters declined. … There are now 21.2 million registered voters, which is 84.7 percent of the eligible voter pool — the highest share in the last 68 years. It\\'s also some 3 million more registered voters than in 2016.”  GUILFOYLE ALLEGATIONS — “The secret history of Kimberly Guilfoyle’s departure from Fox,” by the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer: An assistant to the former San Francisco first lady alleged “she was frequently required to work at Guilfoyle’s New York apartment while the Fox host displayed herself naked, and was shown photographs of the genitalia of men with whom Guilfoyle had had sexual relations.”  — “‘It’s Not Real Justice’: Vallejo Officer Fired, But Not For Deadly Force,” by KQED’s Ericka Cruz Guevarra.  CALIFORNIA ON FIRE  — “The fire retardant dropped out of planes? It’s sticky, gooey and made in the Southland,” by the LA Times’ Samantha Masunaga.  FIRE IMPACT — “Santa Cruz County lost almost 1,000 homes to the CZU fires. Its housing crisis is now worse than ever,” by the SF Chronicle’s Mallory Moench.  CORONAVIRUS UPDATES  CHURCH CLOSURES — “Appeals court swats request to pull California\\'s restrictions on religious gatherings,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White: “A majority of the panel noted that congregate activities like going to movie theaters, attending concerts and watching sporting events have also been curtailed or prohibited. The court also backed California’s argument that transmission risk ‘is elevated in indoor congregate activities, including in-person worship services.’”  NOT SO AMUSED — “Disneyland’s push to reopen sets up critical moment in California’s coronavirus fight,” by the LA Times’ Soumya Karlamangla, Phil Willon and Stephanie Lai: “The Walt Disney Co., one of the world’s largest entertainment companies, partially blamed California’s strict reopening rules for massive layoffs in its theme park division after trying unsuccessfully to get officials to allow the gates of Disneyland to swing open again.”  HE\\'S OUT — “Disney chairman quits Gavin Newsom’s economic task force as company announces layoffs,\" by the Sac Bee\\'s Sophia Bollag: \"The spokesperson would not say why or precisely when Iger left the task force, but the news comes as the Newsom administration is preparing to release guidance on theme park reopening that the industry is criticizing.\"  — “Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine study to be the third massive trial to reach San Diego,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Jonathan Wosen: “Local researchers aim to enroll 3,000 to 3,500 San Diegans. That includes 2,000 volunteers at UC San Diego and 1,000 to 1,500 at M3 Wake Research, an organization that provides clinical research facilities and services.”  THE FIFTY: Governors and mayors have never mattered more to the future of the nation, and The Fifty, a new series from POLITICO, takes you inside the role they’re playing in the pandemic and more.  PRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT  WILSON FOR TRUMP — “Pete Wilson endorses Trump, says president has \\'very good judgment\\',” by POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci: “Wilson was among nearly seven dozen members of past GOP administrations and Congress who backed Trump in a signed letter that was released by the campaign Thursday and tweeted by the president.”  — “Amazon and Big Tech cozy up to Biden camp with cash and connections,” by Reuters’ Nandita Bose.  HISTORY LESSON — “Trump’s war on election integrity follows a racist playbook used in 1980s Orange County,” by the LA Times’ Gustavo Arellano.  DEBATE FALLOUT — “‘Are we going to choose white supremacy?’ Voters of color react to Trump’s comments,” by the LA Times’ Jenny Jarvie and Brittny Mejia: “Trump’s inflammatory performance on Tuesday and his reluctance to distance himself from right-wing extremists caused shock waves across the nation and social media, provoking a flurry of tweets from NBA stars and rappers, civil right activists and political pundits, as well as actors and actresses.”  CAMPAIGN MODE  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — ZUCK’S BUCKS: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, is channeling some final millions into ballot initiatives: another $4.5 million to Proposition 15, which would raise commercial property taxes, and against Proposition 20, which would roll back sentencing and parole changes, in addition to local housing measures. The initiative’s Mike Troncoso said in a statement that the measures would have “long-term impacts for criminal justice reform, affordable housing policy, and especially for communities of color.”  GIG FIGHT — The labor-backed campaign to beat back Proposition 22, which would exempt app-based companies from reclassifying their workers as employees, is out with its first statewide television spot. The ad accuses these companies of “breaking state employment laws for years” and trying to “buy themselves a new law.” Take a look.  — “CA Dem Cut Employee Health Care Benefits as Real Estate Executive,” by the Free Beacon’s Collin Anderson: “Rouda took control of his late father\\'s real estate agency, HER Realtors, in October 2012. Months later, the California Democrat rescinded health care coverage for workers at the agency, according to the longtime former employee.”  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — LGBTQ POWER: Leading LGBTQ rights organization Equality California is boosting six Democratic House candidates with a digital and mail push.

HISTORY LESSON — “California was a free state. But there was still slavery. Now reparations are on the table,” by WaPo’s Gillian Brockell: “Many White Southerners who moved to the California territory during the Gold Rush (1848 to the mid-1850s) brought the people they enslaved with them. … In exchange for passing legislation making California a free state — tipping the balance of power toward free states — lawmakers also passed a strict fugitive slave law that effectively ‘turned the criminal justice system and legal system in the United States into bounty hunters for slave owners.’”  CLEAN ENERGY COSTS — “California wants to wind down its gas and oil industry. What does it mean for jobs?” by the Sac Bee’s Jeong Park: “Even as the number of clean energy jobs rises in California, the quality of those positions vary wildly, from rooftop solar installers making just above minimum wage to those working in utilities making $50 an hour. Environmental and labor advocates say it’s up to the state to ensure those clean energy jobs are as good as the jobs in the oil and gas industry they will replace.”  — “Dozens of Sacramento massage parlors profit from sexual services. A crackdown may be coming,” by the Sac Bee’s Theresa Clift, Molly Sullivan and Benjy Egel: “Behind the darkened doors in some of these places, women – often immigrants from Asia and speaking very little English – are trafficked and forced into sexual labor, activists and city officials say.”  — “Most San Diego County school districts have reopened or plan to reopen in October,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Kristen Taketa.  SHAKIN’ IT UP: California launched a broad new public education campaign on Thursday that offers residents no-cost tools, resources and information on how to prepare for the next big shaker. “Don’t Get Caught Off Guard,” from the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, includes easy access to Earthquake Warning California, the state’s earthquake warning system.  Cal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci said in a statement to POLITICO that the ability of the public to get “moments of warning before previously unexpected natural disasters’’ will not only save lives, but is “changing the world of mitigation and emergency management.\"  A message from The Great Courses Plus:  SILICON VALLEYLAND  — “House Republicans voice support for antitrust ‘tweaks’ on tech,” by POLITICO’s Cristiano Lima and Leah Nylen: “Key House Republicans on Thursday embraced reining in big tech companies by tweaking antitrust laws and giving federal regulators more resources, but rejected the sweeping regulations or break ups that some Democrats are pushing for.”  DRAGGING ‘EM IN — “Senate panel votes to subpoena CEOs of Google, Facebook and Twitter,” by POLITICO’s John Hendel.

Gavin Newsom had some ‘splainin’ to do Monday.  THE PROBLEM: How is it that California — the vaunted capital of the “innovation economy,’’ home to the giants of Silicon Valley, and “America’s next coming attraction,’’ as Newsom likes to brag — still uses an ancient computer language called COBOL and an IT system that dates back to the earliest days of the internet to handle the unemployment claims of millions of California workers?  That’s what Newsom was forced to address Monday. His “strike force” released a report Saturday with recommendations for improving California\\'s backlogged Employment Development Department, which has become the latest albatross around the governor’s neck since the start of the pandemic. Constituents across the state have reported nightmares at EDD, with the unemployed unable to get through the online claim systems or to reach the department by phone. Some filed claims but never received checks. EDD head Sharon Hilliard projected this week it will take until the end of January to get through the current backlog. To turn things around, the report noted, the department needs to take a two-week \"reset\" before it can accept applications from first-time applicants, POLITICO’s Katy Murphy reported.  Gov. Gavin Newsom gives an update on the state\\'s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Rancho Cordova, Calif., June 26, 2020. | AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, Pool  HE BURIED THE LEAD: Despite the shock at news that unresolved claims are growing to the tune of 10,000 a day — as the LA Times’ Patrick McGreevy reported — and the potential implications for millions of Californians, Newsom buried the lead in his briefing Monday. After a scathing op-ed from the Sac Bee\\'s Gil Duran on Newsom’s weekend dump of information — which critics said aimed to minimize its impact — the governor addressed the EDD crisis, though only after wildfire and Covid-19 updates, including a new PSA on masks starring Oscar the Grouch.  “The work we have to do is self-evident as it relates to unemployment and support for those that are trying to navigate our unemployment and pandemic unemployment assistance system here in the state of California,’’ Newsom said. “This system is an old, 30-plus-year-old technological system. … These legacy COBOL systems that need to be upgraded, frankly, need to just simply be strewn to the waste bin of history.  So now, critics and political opponents have emerged in force to lambaste the Newsom team’s report, which in effect called for a complete system overhaul. (The governor said the Saturday night report release came because “I didn’t want to wait another day.”)  Among them was San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, reported to be exploring a possible run for governor, who tweeted: “It feels like doctors might develop a COVID vaccine before the State of California figures out how to send unemployment checks to people on time. There’s a backlog of 1.5 MILLION unemployment claims. How are Californians supposed to provide for themselves, for their families?”  And John H. Cox, the Republican who ran against Newsom in 2018 — and is exploring another go — told POLITICO Monday that “the world has undergone this complete technological revolution the last 20 years. This is inexcusable, that our government hasn\\'t. And why? You know, we\\'ve had plenty of money to spend on a train that’s way over-budget. Right.”  BOTTOM LINE: With state unemployment at 11.4 percent, and millions counting on those checks, Newsom vowed that tackling problems in the aging system will help Californians get help from EDD faster and far more efficiently in the future. Still, he didn’t offer any timeline on when the relief will be coming.  In other words: “The check’s in the mail”?  Stay tuned.  BUENOS DÍAS, good Tuesday morning. Laid-off health care and hospitality workers will caravan from around California to the State Capitol today to urge Newsom to sign AB 3216. The bill, now awaiting Newsom’s signature, aims to strengthen worker protections during the Covid-19 pandemic by requiring employers to notify laid-off employees of new, open jobs that they may have qualified for. UNITE Here Local 49, which is organizing the protest, will hold a 4 p.m. press conference.  QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"They have this massive valve up north, and as the water comes pouring down from the snow — all beautiful, nice, clean water — they send it out.

I think it\\'s a smelt.\" President Donald Trump on California’s delta smelt in an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin.  TWEETS OF THE DAY: A generational Dem divide on display in response to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s comments in defense of the Senate filibuster and against adding Supreme Court justices: Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs @MichaelDTubbs: “We have to eliminate the filibuster.

TOP TALKERS  PATRIOTIC PLAN? — “California schools launch anti-racism plan, flouting Trump\\'s threats,’’ by POLITICO’s Mackenzie Mays: SACRAMENTO — “The California Department of Education announced new anti-racism lessons and teacher training for school districts on Monday, days after President Donald Trump decried the notion of teaching slavery as a founding tenet of the U.S. and called for a more ‘patriotic education.’”  SPILLWAY — “Oil Companies Are Profiting From Illegal Spills. And California Lets Them,” by the Desert Sun’s Janet Wilson and ProPublica’s Lylla Younes: “Across some of [California’s] largest oil fields, companies have for decades turned spills into profits, garnering millions of dollars from surface expressions that can foul sensitive habitats and endanger workers. … A close review of the state’s new rules shows they contain several large loopholes that keep oil from surface expressions flowing — the result of years of lobbying and pushback by the energy industry.”  MEGHAN’S MOVE — “Gloria Steinem Says She and Meghan Markle Cold-Called U.S. Voters,” by Vanity Fair’s Emily Kirkpatrick: “During her casual conversation with the activist last month, Meghan also expressed her enthusiasm over Kamala Harris\\'s vice-presidential nomination. ‘I’m so excited to see that kind of representation,’ the duchess said at the time. ‘You know, for me, being biracial growing up, whether it was a doll or a person in office, you need to see someone who looks like you in some capacity.’”  — “Abolish the Electoral College or award electors on a proportional basis,” Jessica Levinson and Michael A. Genovese write for CalMatters: “Here’s why California, with our 55 electoral votes, is largely useless when it comes to picking the president of the United States.”  FACE IT — “Controversial facial-recognition software used 30,000 times by LAPD in last decade, records show,” by the LA Times’ Kevin Rector and Richard Winton.  CALIFORNIA ON FIRE  — \"Enormous California wildfire threatens desert homes near LA,\" by the AP\\'s Christopher Weber.  SKELTON’S TAKE — “To study wildfire prevention, Berkeley experts are looking to Baja. Newsom should too,” by the LA Times’ George Skelton: “Baja [California] has a big mountain range that resembles the Sierra Nevada, but it’s healthy and fire-resilient. That’s because until relatively recently, it was managed by nature, not humans — except for Indigenous people who knew what they were doing.”  — “Californians moved to Oregon for affordable housing. Wildfires left them homeless,” by the LA Times’ Molly Hennessy.  — \"Firefighter killed in El Dorado blaze identified as a 14-year veteran,\" by the LA Times\\' Matthew Ormseth.  CORONAVIRUS UPDATES  NEWSOM SIGNS BILL — “California governor signs laws to protect workers from virus,’’ by the AP’s Adam Beam: “California companies must warn their workers of any potential exposure to the coronavirus and must pay their employees workers compensation benefits if they get sick with the disease under two laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Thursday.”  — “L.A.

THE FIFTY: Governors and mayors have never mattered more to the future of the nation, and The Fifty, a new series from POLITICO, takes you inside the role they’re playing in the pandemic and more.  THE TRUMP ERA  — “Trump\\'s TikTok Deal: What Just Happened And Why Does It Matter?,” by NPR’s Bobby Allyn: “On Saturday a striking thing happened: Trump took a victory lap for signing off on a last-ditch deal to rescue TikTok, boasting that the China problem had been solved. A new company would be incorporated in the U.S. and ‘will have nothing to do with China,’ the president said.”  — “President Trump calls injured California cops, one of whom can’t speak and wrote out her responses,” by CNN’s Eliott C. McLaughlin.  SILICON VALLEY SIGNAL? — “Trump officials rush to make it tougher for skilled foreign workers to gain visas,” by Reuters’ Ted Hesson: “Companies across multiple industries are very concerned about the potential disruption these proposals will inflict upon their operations,” Jon Baselice, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive director for immigration policy, said in a statement.”  PRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT  NEW BIDEN CA CAMPAIGN HEAD — Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark J. Gonzalez is taking over as California director for the Biden campaign. Gonzalez said in a statement that California sets the standard on issues “from healthcare, to worker’s rights, to Black lives, down to protecting immigrant rights and especially our right to vote” and vowed to work to “make sure Democrats win up and down the ballot here in California” — a reminder that even if Biden is all but certain to scoop up California’s electoral votes, House races are far less certain.  — “Biden can thank Californians for his big lead in the money race,” by the LA Times’ Evan Halper and Seema Mehta: “Although Biden’s choice of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate turbocharged his fundraising, especially in her home state, the president’s actions have been the bigger impetus to donors.”  KAMALA’S MOMENT — “Supreme Court fight could elevate Kamala Harris’ profile,” by the AP’s Kathleen Ronayne: “A highly anticipated confirmation hearing would almost certainly change that, giving Harris a massive platform to demonstrate her political skills and articulate the campaign’s message that Ginsburg’s successor shouldn’t be chosen until after the election.”  TRUMP\\'S TACTIC — \"Stoking his base, Trump warns of a Kamala Harris presidency,\" by NBC\\'s Sahil Kapur.  CAMPAIGN MODE  LOS ANGELES DA DASH — Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon has officially joined the stampede of Los Angeles elected officials forsaking incumbent LA District Attorney Jackie Lacey and backing her opponent, progressive challenger George Gascón. In a statement, Rendon said Gascón stands on the right side of history as “the voters and the legislature alike continue to embrace reforms to end California\\'s involvement in a failed war on drugs and the policies of mass incarceration that defined the 1980s and 1990s.”  PROP 24 — “California’s Proposition 24 would protect data-privacy law from being weakened in Legislature,” by the SF Chronicle’s Dustin Gardiner: “The Nov. 3 ballot initiative would prohibit legislators from weakening the California Consumer Privacy Act, create a state agency to enforce privacy protections, and give people more control over how tech companies use their personal information, such as race or health data.”  SOLAR SPLIT ROLL FIGHT — Supporters of Prop.15, the “split roll” measure on the November ballot, are challenging new ads that argue it would result in “massive taxes” on solar energy projects in California.  Schools and Communities First, the educational and labor coalition backing Prop. 15 — which says the ballot measure will raise an estimated $12 billion annually for communities and schools — insisted that the ads and website put out by a coalition of agricultural groups make “blatantly false’’ claims about the measure’s impacts on solar projects. Schools and Communities First noted that earlier this month, Newsom signed SB 364, “which ensures that property tax exclusions for solar developments would be unaffected by Prop. 15.”  The California Business Roundtable’s No on 15 campaign website has argued that the bill is a special interest bailout and is unconstitutional. But Prop. 15 backers say that major solar advocacy groups like the Large Scale Solar Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association now back the measure.  A statement via email from the Solar Energy Industries Association: “Our concerns with Proposition 15 have been remedied by the enactment of Senate Bill 364. This bill addresses unintended impacts of Proposition 15 on utility-scale and commercial solar projects and will allow solar development to move forward in California. … .SEIA and its members do not oppose Proposition 15.”  MORE ON PROP 15 — “Forty-two years later, another property tax battle,” by CalMatters’ Dan Walters.

Gov. Phil Murphy got less than 24 hours to enjoy the millionaires tax afterglow before the stench of Trenton again splashed on his administration.  The State Commission of Investigation released a scathing report finding that top Murphy administration staffers knew more than they let on about a patronage hiring spree by former Schools Development Authority chief Lizette Delgado-Polanco.  Read more from Carly Sitrin.  But here’s some news: There will soon be more allegations of malfeasance about top Murphy administration staffers. This time, it’s coming in the form of an amended lawsuit from Blueprint Capital Advisors, a Black-owned firm overseeing $175 million in state investments, that’s suing the state for racial discrimination, retaliation and theft. It has now hired two attorneys linked to Donald Trump: Jay Sekulow of the conservative Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, who you may remember as the president’s lead defense counsel during impeachment, and Michael J. Bowe of Brown Rudnick.  “In my view, it is not just the Division of Investment that has a problem. Broader Trenton has a problem,” Jacob Walthour, Blueprint’s managing principal, said in a phone interview.  The new legal team plans to file an amended complaint within the next couple weeks that will include claims that top Murphy staffers — thus far unnamed — directed retaliatory efforts against the company, as well as other escalations in the case like “double dealing.” It will also likely include defamation claims. This lawsuit\\'s allegations go back to the Christie administration, but they don\\'t stop in January 2018.  And before you ask, yes, I see the irony of two lawyers who represented Trump, who during Tuesday’s debate would not condemn white supremacists, now working on a racial discrimination case.  In a statement, Walthour said he hired the new lawyers “because they both understand that both racial and economic justice for all Americans is at stake in our case and have the track record to ensure justice is served in this case.”  WHERE’S MURPHY? — No public schedule.

South Jersey Democrats will support Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin for re-election, keeping the two legislative leaders in office for another three years. Four Democratic senators from Middlesex — Linda Greenstein (D-Plainsboro), Robert Smith (D-Piscataway), Patrick Diegnan (D-South Plainfield) and Joseph Vitale (D-Woodbridge) — along with Joseph Cryan (D-Union), committed tonight to back Sweeney’s re-election.

Just look at his budget,” by The Record’s Charles Stile: “For all his self-congratulation over restoring the millionaires tax to 10.75% — a top rate in effect briefly during the stormy reign of Jon S. Corzine, New Jersey\\'s first Goldman Sachs governor — the budget Murphy signed is, in many ways, a replay of the tax-and-spend-and-borrow pattern that has managed New Jersey\\'s fiscal affairs over the past three decades ... the new budget could also serve as a diploma certifying Murphy\\'s graduation into the political academy of Trenton. He met all the course requirements. He cut deals — he agreed to rebates in exchange for votes on the millionaires tax. He strategically doled out the pork— Middlesex and Essex counties are critical for any Democratic candidate for in 2021. And he placated as many constituencies as possible by going on a spending spree. It\\'s a far cry from Murphy\\'s first two years, when Coughlin and Senate President Stephen Sweeney mobilized to teach him a lesson in the transactional norms of the Statehouse.”  THE THIRD-YOUNGEST SENATOR FROM BERGEN COUNTY — “Weinberg says she’ll decide by year’s end whether to seek reelection” by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: “State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, one of New Jersey’s most prominent progressive leaders, said she will decide by the end of the year whether to seek reelection in 2021. ‘As soon as I do [decide], I’ll call my family, my two [Assembly] colleagues, and then I’ll call you,’ the 85-year-old Weinberg (D-Bergen) said in a phone interview Wednesday morning. \\'Certainly, by the end of the year.\\' At this point in her last term, Weinberg had already committed to seeking reelection. There’s been heavy speculation in Bergen County as to whether Weinberg, who’s been in the Legislature for 26 years, will seek reelection.”  NURSING HOMES — “Trump administration loosened rules for indoor nursing home visits, but NJ\\'s remain stricter,” by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “New Jersey could soon allow more people to visit inside nursing homes again, but operators and family members are growing impatient that the state hasn\\'t loosened its guidelines even after getting approval from the federal government. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued guidelines on Sept. 17 for long-term care facilities to follow for reopening. They include: No new onset of COVID-19 for 14 days, no reported outbreaks at facilities and a limit on the number of visitors. And if the conditions are met, nursing homes ’must facilitate in-person visitation consistent with the regulations,’ the memo said. ‘Failure to facilitate visitation, without adequate reason related to clinical necessity or resident safety, would constitute a potential violation of’ federal regulations, it said ... Over a week after the new federal guidance, advocates are left confused about why the state hasn\\'t given nursing homes the OK to open if they meet the new standards”  TWO-THIRDS OF A MASTRO — “Murphy doubles funds for lawyers for ICE detainees,” by WNYC’s Matt Katz: “Immigrants held while awaiting deportation or immigration court proceedings do not have a right to attorneys, like criminal defendants do. While almost all immigrants arrested by ICE in New York get attorneys through a program funded by the city and state, that wasn\\'t the case in New Jersey until Murphy allocated $3.1 million last year. Now, he\\'s doubled that. While that money still covers fewer than half of the hundreds of New Jerseyans detained by ICE, statistics show that immigrants with lawyers are more likely to avoid deportation, so immigrant advocates said the money will keep families together and save the lives of asylum seekers.”  PANCADEMIA — New Jersey reports 11 Covid outbreaks linked to in-school transmission, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: New Jersey has documented Covid-19 outbreaks linked to in-person instruction at 11 schools, representing a little more than 40 cases, state officials said Wednesday. “Eleven outbreaks with a total of 43 cases three weeks in? Probably as good as we would’ve hoped,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during his regular briefing in Trenton. Neither the schools nor the districts were identified.  THIS TIME THEY’LL BE MORE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SEND CHECKS TO SUPER PACS THAT DISCLOSE DONORS — PSEG will again ask BPU for $300 million annual nuclear subsidy, by POLITICO’s Samantha Maldonado: PSEG on Thursday will apply for nearly $1 billion in nuclear subsidies over three years in the second round of awards from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. The applications for zero-emissions certificates, or ZECs, will be for the second, three-year eligibility period. The state utility regulator last year awarded PSEG’s three nuclear power plants in Salem County $300 million in annual subsidies for the first three-year period. The board’s vote went against the recommendation of BPU staff, who found there was no need for the subsidies, and caused considerable controversy among elected officials and other stakeholders who spoke out against the initial subsidies.  PENSIONS — “N.J. public worker pension earnings fell short of goals during the fiscal year,” by NJ Advance Media’s Samantha Marcus: “New Jersey’s pension fund for government workers on Wednesday reported a return of 1.2% in the fiscal year that ended June 30, trailing its policy benchmark and other large public public pension funds … The state assumes the fund will return 7.5 percent on its investments over the long term … Between July 1, 2019 and June 30, the fund returned 1.2%. In the first six months of the calendar year its investments were down 3.54%.”  EDUCATION — Why New Jersey’s progressive school funding formula still isn’t working for some children, by POLITICO’s Carly Sitrin: New Jersey’s school funding formula is among the most progressive in the nation, but a new report shows the state’s failure to fully fund it has left a significant equity gap between white and Latinx students — and the coronavirus is threatening to widen it. Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday signed into law a $32.7 billion, nine-month spending plan that holds school funding flat and sets the state back in its seven-year commitment to fully fund the formula and achieve equity in spending for all children. That means another year Latinx students will have to make do with less funding than the state says they need, compounded by difficulties wrought by the pandemic, including access to technology and a disproportionate toll the virus has been taking on their families and communities. It will also send the state scrambling for more money next year when New Jersey — which already has one of the worst credit ratings among the states — will be facing an increasingly uncertain fiscal picture.  — “These restaurants reopened.

Tom Malinowski of lobbying to \\'protect sexual predators.\\' On Tuesday, followers of QAnon — a collective delusion that alleges President Donald Trump is fighting a Satanist cabal of elites who abuse children — targeted him, leading to death threats. Malinowski had coauthored a bipartisan resolution last month that would have the House formally condemn QAnon and on Tuesday he was the subject of a ‘Q drop’ — conspiracy-filled, false messages posted to message boards from the self-proclaimed US government insider to their followers … Malinowski received multiple death threats on Tuesday after the Q post went up, he and his office told BuzzFeed News.”  TELLING IT LIKE IT WASN’T — Republicans plead with Trump to hit white supremacists harder, by POLITICO’s Nick Niedzwiadek, Marianne LeVine and Burgess Everett: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, downplayed the alarm many had to the president’s remarks, saying on ABC’s ‘Good Morning America’ that he \"heard it differently.\" Pressed … on the president\\'s ‘stand by’ directive, Christie reiterated that he “didn’t read it that way, but if you want to read it that way that’s your prerogative.  $2 MILLION — That\\'s the sum Rep.

New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli on Wednesday reported that the positivity rate on new tests taken in the Ocean County township had climbed to 27 percent as of Sept. 26, nine times the statewide spot positivity rate. In addition, she said, 134 of the 722 new cases reported statewide on Wednesday originated in Lakewood, a community of 104,000 whose growth has been fueled by a large Orthodox Jewish community. “Ocean County is our main focus right now,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during his regular briefing in Trenton. While local community leaders, including elected officials, rabbis and other religious leaders have cooperated with the health department, that hasn’t always translated “in the trenches.” “Is it a canary in the coal mine? I don’t know,” he later added. “I hope it isn’t. I hope it is not.”  — \"Murphy to visit Ocean County Friday amid scramble to contain Lakewood outbreak\"  — “\\'Stay focused\\': Orthodox Jewish leaders ask for caution during holidays as Lakewood COVID-19 cases spike\"  — “Did [Lakewood] school mishandle kid’s COVID-19 case?

Former East Orange resident Willis Edwards III, 49, is now facing 31 crimes, which include conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and taking kickbacks in connection with the business of Orange, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a release.”  PATERSON FAILS — “Despite funding the purchase of body cameras, Paterson is NJ\\'s only major city without them,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “Paterson remains the only major New Jersey city where police officers are not equipped with body cameras, according to a recent survey by the state Attorney General\\'s Office. Newark police have 1,123 body cameras, Camden is next with 412, then Elizabeth with 342, Jersey City with 276 and Trenton with 200, as found in a recent survey conducted by the office of Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. The Paterson City Council approved the purchase of 150 body cameras in January, but the Police Department didn’t start training its officers on the devices until September, law enforcement officers said. Paterson won’t begin wearing the cameras while on duty until after the Municipal Law Department and Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office approve policies for their use, officials said.”  BARRED MIZPAH — “County criminal investigation closes Mizpah fire co., emergency township meeting,” by The Daily Journal’s Joseph P.

With day one of indoor dining on the books, one of the city’s most vital industries is looking ahead to many more months to come of tight restrictions, nervous diners, and a tenuous chance to recover from the beating they’ve already taken over six months of partial closures.  The state gave the OK for restaurants to open at 25 percent of their normal capacity in the five boroughs, compared to 50 percent in the rest of the state. The reopening, once scheduled for July, had been pushed back out of fears that patrons eating and drinking indoors would fuel the spread of the coronavirus. Indoor dining is going forward for now despite a recent spike in the city’s infection rates, but the upticks add to an atmosphere of uncertainty as the fall progresses.  Some restaurant owners proudly threw open the doors to their dining rooms on Wednesday, while others didn’t bother, saying it isn’t worth it financially, or they aren’t confident their customers and employees would feel safe. “It’s not going to be like it was before,” said Edward Vila, the manager of Ecuatoriana in Harlem, who is offering indoor tables but said most of his customers are opting for takeout. Amorina Cucina Rustica owner Ellen Fishman said the Prospect Heights restaurant will stick with popular outdoor seating. “I don’t believe many people would be comfortable with it and I don’t believe my staff would be comfortable,” she said.  The state plans to review Covid-19 numbers and decide whether to increase capacity to 50 percent in November. The city says restaurants can expect inspections to check compliance, which include mandatory temperature checks for diners and a prohibition on bar seating, especially in the Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods where coronavirus clusters are spreading. And count Mayor Bill de Blasio among the diners who aren’t eager to head back indoors. “I personally just prefer outdoor dining, and as long as it’s available I would always choose it,” he said.

A message from Uber: CA voters & app workers voted overwhelmingly to protect workers’ flexibility and provide new benefits. Time for New York to follow, see how here.      WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “DESPITE INCREASED public-awareness campaigns, testing efforts and enforcement, the percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 continued to rise in several New York City neighborhoods, prompting Gov. Andrew Cuomo to say that the city isn’t doing enough to prevent the spread. Six of eight hot-spot areas, in South Brooklyn and Queens, saw an increase in the share of people testing positive for Covid-19, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference Wednesday. The city is also monitoring four additional areas, he said, where the rate of people testing positive for the virus is trending up. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said the seven-day rate of people who test positive is 1.46%, up from Tuesday. The one-day positivity rate was less than 1% on Wednesday, down from 3.25% on Tuesday, a high that hadn’t been seen since early June. ‘It is so important for everyone to go out and get tested,’ said Mr. de Blasio … Mr. de Blasio said the city would send some 400 police officers and hundreds of other city workers to the affected areas to provide free masks and remind New Yorkers that wearing them is the law.” Wall Street Journal’s Melanie Grayce West and Jimmy Vielkind  — The city’s Test and Trace program has fewer than half a dozen Yiddish speakers on staff as city officials struggle to contain the growing coronavirus outbreak in several neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations in Brooklyn and Queens.  LINCOLN RESTLER, a former aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio who got his start in politics taking on the Brooklyn Democratic Party machine, is running for City Council in a crowded primary. Restler registered a campaign account on Tuesday for the eight-way race to replace the term-limited Steve Levin in a district that spans wealthy Brooklyn Heights, hipster havens of Williamsburg and Greenpoint and an Orthodox Jewish area that is instrumental in local elections. He is kicking off his campaign with a proposal to curtail the free-market will of property owners through legislation in the city and Albany that would limit how much rent they could charge for vacant residential and commercial spaces. In doing so, he also took a swipe at de Blasio’s record on affordable housing, saying it resembled that of his political nemesis and predecessor, pro-business Mayor Mike Bloomberg. POLITICO’s Sally Goldenberg  “NYPD OFFICERS who don’t wear masks should face ‘penalties,’ Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday — nearly seven months into a pandemic and after months of dodging the issue. ‘Our officers should be held to the same standard as all citizens [in] all public standards,’ de Blasio said during a press conference. ‘If they don’t there should be penalties,’ he added of the governor’s executive order issued in April requiring face-coverings when social distancing isn’t possible. The mayor went on to claim the ‘vast majority are in fact wearing masks’ — while at the same moment, reporters counted at least 18 cops huddled outside the press room at 1 Police Plaza with only three wearing masks. At least 16 more were seen congregated near an elevator bank with none spied wearing masks.” New York Post’s Julia Marsh and Craig McCarthy  “THE NEW YORK City Council is set to vote on expelling Bronx lawmaker Andy King from the body on Monday after its ethics watchdog hit the councilman with a new slew of charges, alleging he continued to abuse his staff and stole city funds. The Council posted a notice of a rare Monday meeting, which sources confirmed was to consider removing the misbehaving Democrat from office. Any expulsion vote requires a two-thirds majority in the body, which appears likely as Council Speaker Corey Johnson said Tuesday he would back the move and King appears to have few allies left in the body. The Council’s ethics committee announced Tuesday it had found substantial evidence of misbehavior by King — ending the panel’s third investigation into allegations against the politician who was once best known for wearing bow-ties.” New York Post’s Nolan Hicks  “CITIGROUP EXECUTIVE Ray McGuire is turning to one of his closest associates in the business community to guide him on what appears to be a likely run for mayor of New York. McGuire, according to people familiar with the matter, has turned to Charles Phillips, the former CEO of the software company Infor, as an advisor while he seriously considers running for the city’s highest office. Phillips, these people added, has been in on meetings with potential supporters, including those with ties to Wall Street, and others guiding McGuire on his potential run.” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz      WHAT ALBANY\\'S READING  “RENSSELAER County officials refused to let a state Health Department inspection team into the county nursing home Wednesday, saying the inspectors wouldn’t provide proof they had tested negative for COVID-19. It is a continuation of a clash between the county and state over access to the nursing home. ‘We just wanted the state to follow the state rules,’ said Richard Crist, the county\\'s director of operations. Crist said the county wanted the group of about seven Health Department employees to either show paperwork that they had tested negative for the virus or to sign a county-provided form attesting that they had tested negative for the disease. The state group departed Van Rensselaer Manor (VRM), the county nursing home, around 10 a.m., according to county officials. Similar scenes played out in July.” Times Union’s Kenneth C. Crowe II  “IN AN EFFORT to detect surges of Covid-19 patients earlier, before they arrive at an emergency room, one New York hospital system is turning to web-browsing traffic . Officials for Northwell Health, which operates 23 hospitals, have developed a predictive model that examines more than a dozen data points in millions of page views of its website to determine when physicians might reliably see an uptick in the number of people coming to the hospital and testing positive for Covid-19. Using data from the first six months of the pandemic in New York, officials found that changes in certain areas of web traffic preceded Covid-19 positive diagnoses in the hospital by two weeks.” Wall Street Journal’s Melanie Grayce West  TWO DOWNSTATE FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS plants facing tougher emissions limits and eventual extinction are making a longshot promise that they could someday burn hydrogen produced from sun and wind energy. But clean energy groups say the pitch is a mirage — a last-ditch effort by the plants to avoid closure by suggesting they can make the switch from burning fossil fuels to a technology that is, so far, not available for widespread use and would present enormous costs to implement. “It’s so unrealistic that it’s almost laughable,” said Carlos Garcia, with the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance. POLITICO’s Marie J. French  \"A BIPARTISAN commission tasked with redrawing New York’s legislative and congressional district lines needs money to begin hiring staff.

But amid a major budget deficit, the agency has not released those funds to the commission, even as the body faces tight deadlines to complete its work next year.

Instead, the Cuomo administration wanted the Board to mail voters just the corrected absentee ballot return envelopes, asking voters to use the ballots they were sent in the first erroneous mailing. On Monday, voters in Brooklyn who opened their absentee ballots found their return envelopes—known as the ‘oath’ envelope because the voter signs it—labeled with the wrong names and addresses. … The suggestion came at a time when mail-in balloting is under intense scrutiny, particularly by President Trump and his supporters.” WNYC’s Brigid Bergin  — “The New York City Board of Elections has not submitted a state-mandated report on its staffing needs for this fall, blowing past a September 20 deadline set by Governor Andrew Cuomo and raising concerns about the city’s preparedness for the consequential general election. It is the only jurisdiction in the state to miss the deadline, according to officials at the State Board of Elections, to which the reports are due. The mandate and deadline, set in a late-August executive order, was intended to ensure election administrators were ready for a record number of votes, and ready to count them quickly, including a quantity of mailed-in ballots expected to dwarf what they faced in the chaotic June primaries.” Gotham Gazette’s Ethan Geringer-Sameth  TRUMP\\'S NEW YORK  “A WAVE OF emotions washed over Jesus Lira when he found out that President Trump has only paid a few hundred dollars in federal income taxes since the early 2000s. ‘It was a little bit of everything — angry, sad, confused,’ said Lira, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who used to work as a cook at Trump’s Westchester County golf club. ‘The president, my former boss, isn’t paying any taxes. How is that even possible?’ Lira, who’s among dozens of undocumented ex-employees of Trump’s company, was referring to a Sunday report by the New York Times that revealed the president paid just $750 per year in federal income tax in 2016 and 2017 and no income tax at all for 10 out of the previous 15 years. Outraged by the bombshell report, Lira and three other undocumented ex-Trump Organization workers provided the Daily News with records this week showing that they paid tens of thousands of dollars in federal income taxes while working for the president — despite their immigration status.” New York Daily News’ Chris Sommerfeldt  FROM THE DELEGATION  “SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have pulled out of next week’s New Yorker Festival, the star-studded annual event held by The New Yorker magazine, in solidarity with unionized editorial staff members, who are planning a digital picket line.

The Rent Stabilization Association and the Community Housing Improvement Program filed the lawsuit last July alleging that the overhauled regulations enacted in June 2019 — which included a slew of tenant-friendly reforms — amount to an illegal taking of private property. “No precedent binding on this Court has ever found any provision of a rent-stabilization statute to violate the Constitution,” Eric Komitee, district judge for the Eastern District, wrote in a Wednesday decision, adding that even if the June 2019 changes go beyond prior regulations, it\\'s not for a lower court to reverse.

TGIF!  BAKER\\'S BROAD POWER ON BEACON HILL— Gov. Charlie Baker\\'s influence in Massachusetts government will become even broader by the end of the year. After the unexpected death of Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants, it\\'s likely that Baker will soon be in a position to select the entire bench of the Supreme Judicial Court.  The last governor to appoint the entire court was John Hancock, according to the Boston Globe , who was the first and third governor of the Bay State.  Baker has already named five justices to the seven-member court during his time as governor. Baker will fill Gants\\' seat on the court, and another spot on the bench when Justice Barbara Lenk retires later this year. The Governor\\'s Council approves Baker\\'s appointments to the court.  Naming the entire SJC would be a long-lasting example of Baker\\'s power as governor, as justices are not required to retire until they are 70. Baker\\'s youngest appointment, Justice Kimberly Budd, will be 70 in 2036.  This comes as the court is deciding whether Baker\\'s other big area of influence — executive orders — are legal. The governor has issued dozens of executive orders to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, having to do with travel restrictions, facial coverings, flu shots and a host of other issues. Eighty-one percent of Massachusetts residents approve of how Baker has handled coronavirus, according to a poll conducted in June.  The Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments last week in the lawsuit brought by business owners and others. The issue is not whether Baker\\'s decisions were good or bad, but whether he should have relied on the Civil Defense Act for his authority. Justices seemed wary of upending Baker\\'s Covid-19 response, according to CommonWealth Magazine .

SCOOP: DEM PARTY CHAIR FACES A CHALLENGE — There\\'s a battle brewing for control of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.  State Democratic Party chairman Gus Bickford is likely to face two challengers in his bid for another four-year term next month. Former gubernatorial candidate Bob Massie is running for the seat, he confirmed to POLITICO. And former candidate for lieutenant governor Mike Lake has been making behind-the-scenes phone calls in preparation for his own run, according to three sources.  The party\\'s next leader will be at the helm when the governor\\'s race comes in 2022, an office Democrats are desperate to win. But the party\\'s 2018 nominee, Jay Gonzalez, only received 33 percent of the vote against popular GOP Gov. Charlie Baker. While the party hasn\\'t been able to put a dent in Baker\\'s popularity, Democrats have been able to pick up seats in the state legislature over the last several years.  \"A lot of things have changed over the last four years. It\\'s not the same world, it\\'s not the same America, it\\'s not the same Massachusetts. And I just don\\'t think the party is doing enough to bring new people in and new energy, young people and so forth, but also to meet those challenges,\" Massie told me in a phone call last night. \"As long as the party is still unclear about structures or still battling internal issues, it\\'s going to be harder to beat [Baker].\"  Massie said he\\'d spoken to Lake, and during that conversation both men indicated they plan to run for the seat. Lake did not respond to requests for comment yesterday afternoon.  For his part, Bickford said he is \"laser focused\" on electing Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3, and pointed to the party\\'s record flipping seats on Beacon Hill. \"I do plan to run for re-election and I welcome any candidate to the race for chair of this great party,\" Bickford said in an email.  One issue likely to come up when the party votes next month is its handling of allegations against Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse by a group of college Democrats, which were later found to be part of an apparent political smear. Bickford retained former state Sen. Cheryl Jacques to investigate what happened, though some party members remain dissatisfied. Lake is among the Massachusetts Democrats who have been vocal about the party\\'s role in the situation and choice of investigator, according to internal emails shared with POLITICO.  The state party will vote for its next chair less than two weeks after the Nov. 3 election. The contest is a runoff, meaning if no candidate wins by over 50% of the vote, the race will go to a second ballot. Bickford won the seat in a 2014 runoff against Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins and former candidate for lieutenant governor Steve Kerrigan. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the election will be conducted virtually.  PROGRAMMING NOTE: Massachusetts Playbook will not publish Monday, Oct. 12.

WU EYES HISTORY-MAKING MAYORAL BID — If Boston Mayor Marty Walsh runs for reelection next year, beating him won\\'t be easy. The last time an incumbent mayor lost in Boston was in 1949. And that was the late Mayor James Michael Curley, who spent part of his term in a federal prison.  Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu is running for mayor and hoping to change that trend. Wu announced her campaign yesterday, and addressed Boston\\'s tendency to reelect incumbent mayors during an interview on WBUR.  \"We love our history in Boston and the reality as a city that is full of history is we know no one is the first until they do it and it happens,\" Wu said. \"We\\'re actually building a movement here to connect with the real history of Boston, our legacy as a city that has always stood up for what is right, fighting for those systemic big picture changes even when the odds are slim.\"  If Walsh does run for reelection, how Boston handles the coronavirus pandemic over the coming year will be key. Covid-19 has impacted everything — schools, public health, housing and homelessness, transportation and the economy. The mayor is well-liked, and he won reelection with 66 percent of the vote in 2017 against former City Councilor Tito Jackson.  \"I want to commend Councilor Wu on her decision. I have great respect for her or anyone who runs for office. I look forward to more conversations about how we can move our city forward,\" Walsh said during a press conference on Tuesday. He passed on a question about whether his administration mishandled Boston\\'s economic boom, as Wu has suggested, and hinted that the mayoral field may grow. \"Whether it\\'s the councilor or anyone else that might decide to think about running for mayor, there will be conversations later on at some point about all that.\"  Here\\'s something to watch: Many of Sen. Ed Markey\\'s outspoken supporters from the Sept. 1 primary have shifted their online organizing power to Wu. Making things a little complicated is the fact that Walsh endorsed Markey for reelection against Rep. Joe Kennedy III, while Wu stayed out of the primary.  But don\\'t expect next year\\'s mayoral race to be a repeat of what happened this month. The mood of the electorate changes from year to year, especially with the presidential election looming and the ongoing pandemic, and without a blockbuster statewide primary on the ballot. If the most recent primary followed what happened in 2018, progressive primary challengers like Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse and state legislative candidates Jordan Meehan and Damali Vidot may have won.  Instead, incumbents ruled on Sept. 1 — Markey, Rep. Richard Neal and state Reps. Kevin Honan and Dan Ryan, among others, all fended off primary challengers. That\\'s a shift from two years earlier when a slate of progressive Black and Latino candidates — Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and state Reps. Nika Elugardo and Jon Santiago — upset incumbents or won a tough open-seat primary in 2018.  Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

HOW #MAPOLI REACTED TO THE DEBATE — President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden squared-off last night in a chaotic debate where the president once again refused to say whether he\\'d accept the election results in November.  The spectacle left some political observers wondering if the candidates should scrap the next two debates altogether. Just look at the front pages of the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald. The Globe\\'s headline reads \"CHAOS ON THE DEBATE STAGE,\" while the Herald opted for \"MUD FIGHT.\"  The Trump-Biden showdown was panned by many Bay State elected officials as troubling, especially when the president sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of voting by mail and declined to denounce white supremacists. Support for the Democratic candidate n its bizarre nature, especially because it happened against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.  \"Why is it so hard for @realDonaldTrump to condemn white supremacy?\" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh wrote on Twitter . \"He is not a president. He is a disgrace.\"  Sen. Ed Markey said Trump was \"delegitimizing our election on national TV ,\" while Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned debate watchers that they should \"vote like our democracy depends on it — because it does.\" And Attorney General Maura Healey reacted by saying \"Donald Trump is trying to scare people and keep them from voting.\"  \"Did he denounce the Proud Boys and we missed it?\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley asked , referencing the far-right group. Trump was asked to denounce white nationalist groups during the debate, and instead said members should \"stand back and stand by.\"  On the Republican side, GOP Gov. Charlie Baker did not react publicly to the debate last night, and has not said who he plans to vote for in November. Massachusetts Republican Party chair Jim Lyons, however, said he is \"proud to support President Trump\" after the debate. Members of the Republican State Committee declared Trump had defeated Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, the debate moderator, with Biden as a witness.  Only around 460,000 Massachusetts voters — fewer than 10% — are registered Republicans, according to the secretary of state\\'s office .

Trump has since instructed the Commerce Department to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count for the purpose of congressional reapportionment. That effort was blocked by a federal court earlier this month, but the administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court just last week.  Prior to the Trump administration, Ginsburg was a key vote in support of enshrining protections for the LGBTQ community.  She joined the majority opinion in Windsor v. United States, the 2013 case that struck down a law preventing same-sex couples from receiving the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples.  In the Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage, Ginsburg also sided with the 5-4 majority.  All of these cases were split along ideological lines, with a conservative member joining the court’s liberals — suggesting that an even greater conservative edge on the Supreme Court will change the outcome on similar issues in the future.  Ginsburg\\'s death also leaves a void from her outsized voice on gender equality. She served as director of the Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union earlier in her career, arguing several cases before the Supreme Court.  And after joining the high court in 1993 as only the second female justice, she would go on to pen several landmark opinions on gender discrimination, including in the 1996 case United States v. Virginia, which invalidated the Virginia Military Institute’s male-only admission policy.  When the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that Lilly Ledbetter, an employee at GoodYear Tire, could not sue over sex discrimination because she waited too long to file the complaint, Ginsburg read her searing dissent of the decision from the bench.  \"Title VII was meant to govern real-world employment practices, and that world is what the court today ignores,” Ginsburg said in her rebuke, referring to the equal employment clause of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  The case inspired Congress to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which reset the 180-day statute of limitations with each paycheck. Two years after the high court\\'s decision, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in 2009.  Ginsburg\\'s absence could also slow efforts by Democrats and several states to finally ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would guarantee equal treatment under the law regardless of sex.  The Equal Rights Amendment was passed by Congress in 1972, but by the 1982 ratification deadline, only 35 of the necessary 38 state legislatures had approved it. While Virginia, following Nevada and Illinois, has since approved the amendment, five states have also rescinded their ratification, creating murky legal questions that will likely land before the Supreme Court.  It’s unclear how Ginsburg — who was historically a strong supporter of women’s rights — would have voted on extending the 1982 deadline, but she did say she would have liked for supporters to “start over” with a new ERA, rather than trying to revive the original one.  \"I would like to see a new beginning,\" Ginsburg said. “There is too much controversy about latecomers.\"'}\n",

She said the Census Bureau was “chaotic, dilatory, and incomplete” in following her original injunction, and issued a clarified injunction, directing the Bureau that it must continue its count through Oct. 31, and publicize its efforts to do so, including texting employees on Friday to inform them.  On Friday evening, a release from the Bureau said that it had messaged employees to say the count will go on. “As a result of court orders, the October 5, 2020 target date is not operative, and data collection operations will continue through October 31, 2020,” the message read. “Employees should continue to work diligently and enumerate as many people as possible. Contact your supervisor with any questions.”  The final schedule still remains in flux: The government has appealed Koh’s rulings, but a circuit court rejected a plea for a stay earlier in the week.  Like much of American life, the decennial count of every person in the country was thrown into disarray by the pandemic. The Census Bureau initially pleaded with Congress to extend deadlines for the count for 120 days.  The proposed deadlines would have pushed field collection until the end of October, with apportionment data — the population count used for determining the number and population of each state's congressional districts — being submitted to the president by April 30, 2021, instead of by year's end. Congress never granted the extension, and in early August, the Bureau officially announced it was reversing its request for an extension and would deliver apportionment data by the end of the year.  The shortened timeline worried experts both inside and outside the agency, who feared that a politically motivated acceleration could lead to a flawed count that determines billions of dollars of funding and how states are represented in the House of Representatives. Koh's ruling mandates that the Bureau follow the schedule the agency asked Congress for in light of the pandemic.  Simultaneously, there is other legal battles over a July memorandum issued by President Donald Trump, which looked to exclude undocumented immigrants from the appointment count. A separate panel of judges blocked that memorandum in September, which has also been appealed by the government to the Supreme Court.  It's not clear when apportionment data will ultimately be finalized, including whether it would occur before Jan. 20 of next year, the presidential inauguration, which could result in a change of administrations depending on the election results.  Earlier on Friday, the Bureau announced that over 99 percent of American households have been enumerated. However, several states are below that benchmark.\"}\n",

Harris is the first woman of color to be nominated for vice president by one of the major political parties. The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants would also be the first woman vice president in U.S. history.  Trump went after Harris during a rally in Mosinee, Wis., where he hit his usual campaign talking points — from lauding his administration’s tax reform to criticizing his Democratic challengers. His attack on Harris came as he revisited the crowded Democratic primary field of earlier this year, repeating old insults for his former challengers.  Attacking Harris has become a major part of the Trump campaign playbook. The president repeatedly characterizes Harris as a California liberal and among the most far-left candidates in the Senate, someone who he says is out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans. The attacks reflect the Trump campaign’s difficulty leveling similar character attacks against Biden, who Trump has claimed is a puppet of more leftist wings of the Democratic Party.  Many of the president’s attacks on his Democratic challengers are exaggerated or flat-out untrue. While Trump has claimed that Harris and Biden want to “defund the police” and turn a blind eye toward looting and rioters amid anti-racist protests that have ballooned over the summer, both of the Democratic candidates have voiced their support for law enforcement and rejected violence in protests.  But that hasn’t tempered his strikes. During his Thursday rally, Trump called Harris a “vicious” candidate, alluding to her clashes with Biden on the debate stage when both were still vying for the Democratic nomination. The two candidates got into heated back-and-forths, particularly on issues related to race.  Harris, Trump said, was the candidate “who treated sleepy Joe the worst” — using one of his many mocking nicknames for Biden.  “I said brilliantly he will never pick her. Because she was too terrible to him,” Trump said. “But she picked him and hopefully that’s going to be history. It’s not going to matter.”'}\n",

Ron DeSantis answers a question during a roundtable meeting in August. | Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP DeSantis loses court pick amid claims of \\'racial tokenism\\'  TALLAHASSEE — The Florida Supreme Court blocked Renatha Francis\\' appointment to the state’s high court Friday, ruling her ineligible for the job, and halting Gov. Ron DeSantis‘ pick of the second Black woman to ever serve on the panel.  The decision punctuates a monthslong legal fight infused with racial politics and unusual alliances, and appears likely to force the Republican governor to select a different judge to sit on the court.  DeSantis tapped Francis in May to fill one of two vacancies, and he went on to highlight the Palm Beach County judge, a Black woman born in Jamaica, as evidence of his commitment to adding diversity to the court.  But Francis, who would have been the only sitting Black justice, quickly came under scrutiny because she had not been a member of the Florida Bar for 10 years, a requirement in the state constitution. A lawsuit was filed by state Rep. Geraldine Thompson (D-Orlando) challenging the Francis pick, setting up the multi-layered political drama and Friday’s eventual rejection, which admonished the governor over his legal arguments.  The unanimous decision was an unambiguous smackdown of a Republican governor by a court that has been widely hailed as conservative-leaning. Justice John Couriel recused himself from the case. DeSantis sought to sway the justices by arguing that Francis’ pick was an “announcement\" and not a formal appointment, but that logic did not persuade the court.  “Either approach leads to the same conclusion: the Governor has not complied with the constitution’s clear commands,” the opinion stated.  Adding to the intrigue of the ruling, which poked a huge hole in DeSantis’ legal argument, was who crafted the argument. The ruling was penned by Justice Carlos Muñiz, a DeSantis appointee to the court who is also on President Donald Trump’s shortlist of potential future U.S. Supreme Court picks.  The lawsuit was filed in July, but the political mad scramble did not kick off until after a Tuesday ruling where the court gave DeSantis one day to convince them they should not order him to pick a new justice.  DeSantis also held a press conference Wednesday that allied the governor with a handful of Broward County Democrats, the political equivalent of dogs and cats coming together. That included Haiti-born House Democrat Dotie Joseph, who supported Francis becoming the first Caribbean-born justice on the Florida Supreme Court. She tried to assuage the concerns of fellow Democrats by arguing Francis was not cut from the mold of Clarence Thomas, the conservative Black jurist on the U.S. Supreme Court.  “My colleagues and I on the Florida Legislative Black Caucus determined that she is not a Clarence Thomas,” Joseph said. “While she may be conservative and a member of the Federalist Society, none of those things in and of themselves disqualify Judge Francis from deserving our support or stamp of approval.”  “All skinfolk ain’t kinfolk,” Joseph added of Thomas.  One day later, Thompson hit back, unloading on DeSantis for what she said was a disingenuous effort to paint critics opposed to the Francis pick on constitutional grounds as opposing a Black woman being appointed to the court.  “This is one of the worst and most egregious examples of racial tokenism that I have seen in my life,” Thompson told reporters.  She noted that there were six constitutionally qualified black judges who applied for the two vacancies on the Florida Supreme Court, but Francis was the only one forwarded to DeSantis by the Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission, which is tasked with recommended a slate of judges the governor must pick from. Only Francis made the final cut.  “They could have selected more [black judges],” Thompson told POLITICO on Friday. “They didn’t.”  The court also addressed critics who believe the 10-year bar membership provision in the Florida constitution is arbitrary and should not be a reason to toss a Florida Supreme Court appointee. To underscore that point, they employed the words of a conservative legal icon: the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  “To some, enforcing rules like these might seem needlessly formalistic when the result is to preclude the appointment of an otherwise qualified candidate,” the opinion stated. “But ‘formalism,’ as Justice Scalia observed, ‘is what makes a government a government of laws and not of men.’”  DeSantis was a member of Congress in 2016 when Scalia died. He took to the House floor to memorialize the legal giant, calling him “one of the all-time greats in American law.”  The court’s Friday ruling went on to needle the Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission, the body tasked with crafting a slate of judges for the governor to pick from.  It’s one of the most powerful panels in the state. It is chaired by prominent insurance lobbyist and GOP donor Fred Karlinsky, and includes among its members Daniel Nordby, a former general counsel to Gov. Rick Scott, Jesse Panuccio, who served both in the Scott administration and in the No. 3 post in President Donald Trump’s Justice Department.  “The JNC itself made the decisions to nominate a constitutionally ineligible candidate, and it is responsible for the consequences of that decision,” the justice wrote.  The court has given DeSantis until noon on Monday to pick one of the seven other judges on the slate put forward by the commission.  None of the remaining candidates are Black.  The ascendant conservative jurist knee-capping the legal defense of the governor who appointed him sparked a full court press messaging effort from DeSantis and his allies, who sought to amplify the historic nature of putting someone with Francis\\' heritage on the state\\'s highest court.  “@GovRonDeSantis came out in support of women, immigrants and Black Florida residents like Jamaican American Judge Renatha Francis who is his pick for the @FlCourts,” tweeted Helen Aguirre Ferré, the Florida GOP executive director who until recently was DeSantis’ communication director, on Wednesday.  “[Thompson] Should be ashamed to play politics & deny the FL Supreme Court the only Black female justice,” she added.'}\n",

He was 91.  The Republican, who served 13 years as the majority leader of the New York state Senate, had been battling cancer, according to the Albany Times Union. He was a resident of suburban Troy.  Bruno was perhaps the paradigmatic figure in an era of New York politics that lasted more three decades.  With his background as a boxer and a Korean War veteran, hair that was characterized as Hollywood-worthy well after he became a septuagenarian, and a general glad-handing nature, he was able to win over a room seconds after entering it.  Bruno was first elected in 1976, the second year of a period during which Democrats firmly controlled the state Assembly and Republicans had a seemingly permanent grasp on the state Senate. The GOP would lose the Senate fewer than five months after he resigned in 2008, beginning a decade of intense power struggles in a chamber that Democrats had traditionally written off.  He became majority leader thanks to a coup launched over Thanksgiving weekend in 1994, weeks after fellow Republican George Pataki ousted Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose son, Andrew, is the state\\'s current governor.  For the better part of 12 years, Pataki, Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver comprised Albany’s fabled “Three Men in a Room,” who met behind closed doors to hash out all the major issues facing state government.  Bruno often sided with Silver, a Democrat, during negotiations, as the two would unite against the governor to fight against proposed spending cuts and for legislative authority. But despite occasionally vitriolic public bickering and budgets that were passed months after they were due, Albany was relatively placid and disputes were settled through bipartisan compromise.  That system began to crumble in 2007. Bruno became the only Republican in a position of power in New York, thanks to the departure of figures like Pataki, who chose not to run for a fourth term in 2006.  New Gov. Eliot Spitzer attempted to steamroll legislators into accepting his positions on issues like campaign finance reform, driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, and the selection of a state comptroller after scandal drove out an incumbent, Alan Hevesi.  Bruno held firm against the then-wildly popular governor. When the Spitzer administration tried to pillory him for an alleged misuse of state planes for political purposes, the senator was able to turn the tables by accusing the governor of engaging in seedy surveillance practices. Months of investigations followed, leaving Spitzer too weakened to stand a chance of surviving the more sordid revelations about his personal life that emerged in 2008.  Bruno left not long after Spitzer\\'s resignation, as he was preparing to deal with looming federal charges involving allegations that he illegally mixed official business with his private interests. He was convicted on two felony charges in 2009.  There was little doubt that there was a blending of his state actions and personal business. But a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of what constitutes improper corruption earned him another trial, and he was eventually found not guilty in 2014.  He always defended Albany’s old way of doing business.  \"The funniest line of attack was when the three men were drawn and quartered for the alleged crime of doling out funds to help them and their allies, as if politicians should be above self-interest,” he wrote in his 2016 memoir.  That self-interest has left its mark on the Albany-Troy region he called home. A local minor league baseball stadium bears his name, and he delighted in pointing out that he helped fund a regional semiconducter industry as well as improvements to Albany\\'s airport and a rail station in Rensselaer.  A funeral mass will be streamed by St. Pius X in Loudonville, N.Y., at a date to be determined.'}\n",

And Black AGs are in charge of studying some the most heated police killings of the year with Minnesota\\'s Keith Ellison investigating Floyd’s death and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a rising star in the GOP who spoke at the Republican National Convention last month, is facing criticism for the pace of his probe into Breonna Taylor’s killing in Louisville.  Raoul has rallied other attorneys general seeking clearer authority from Congress to pursue pattern-or-practice discrimination probes into troubled police forces that the Justice Department under President Donald Trump resists doing. And he is pushing for Illinois to license its police officers, an idea that languished in the state Legislature for years, including his own attempts to resurrect the issue.  Now the state’s Legislative Black Caucus is crafting new criminal justice and victims’ rights legislation — a “Black Agenda” — to be considered in November when lawmakers briefly reconvene. Raoul, who said he also wants attention and “comprehensive, effective services” for crime victims, is on the phone or in Zoom meetings with state legislators and law enforcement officials hashing out the details.  \"I\\'ve heard the attorney general recount a story often — about a shooting outside his home. His son was trying to get inside and officers on the scene expressed an attitude that was less than guardian or protective,” said state Sen. Elgie Sims Jr., an active member of the caucus who has worked with Raoul for years. “The frustration that you hear when he recounts that story illustrates what many Black people feel in those moments. That’s the type of experience he brings to the attorney general job.”  Raoul, who recovered from Covid-19 this summer, has pushed back at Trump, joining other Democratic attorneys general in suing the administration for greater protections for immigrants and to challenge White House efforts to limit the 2020 Census. But he’s also sought support from the U.S. attorney and local special agents with the FBI, DEA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to talk about tackling crime, especially gun violence and drug trafficking, which remain stubborn issues in Chicago and subject to Trump\\'s public ire.  The Floyd case and his own experiences facing a police officer’s gun have prompted Raoul to push the Chicago Police Department to collect data on all incidents in which an officer points a weapon at a member of the public. That work is part of a federal consent decree established in 2018. “My office held strong on including that requirement in the face of resistance from CPD, and I’m determined to ensure it’s implemented,” he said.  Raoul’s experiences growing up on Chicago’s South Side, seeing gun violence outside his front door, navigating Illinois politics and surviving cancer, fuel his ambitions and leave some nerves close to the surface — something that can be seen as a liability.  “I’m a guy who wears my emotion on my sleeve,” he said. As a state senator, he was known to tear up during committee debates.  There is a larger question at hand: In a world in which more diverse voices are starting to reshape the corporate world, media, Congress and the criminal justice system, how do those people — let’s be clear, Black and brown people — get elected to these posts? While Black candidates and officials do make successful runs for many state and federal legislative seats, short of Obama’s presidency, it’s exceedingly rare to see one build a coalition that unlocks statewide support.  “There is an opportunity to right some of the wrongs of these systems by having more diverse leaders who come from these communities, who give lived experiences about how law enforcement treats people. It’s critical,” said Quentin James, president of The Collective PAC, which promotes African Americans running for local, state and federal offices. Collective PAC\\'s numbers are startling: Of the 346 statewide elected offices in the U.S., 18 are held by African Americans. Five percent.'}\n",

I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad and for bowing to the violent mob at home.”  “Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country,” he added.  The previous night, Trump spent the bulk of his time interrupting and interjecting as Biden and moderator Chris Wallace spoke. To some Trump aides, the president’s constant haranguing was positive because it allowed him to determine the terms of the debate and deflected attention from any serious policy discussion, including his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Several others in the Trump orbit thought the president’s persistent interruptions let Biden off the hook and didn’t give the former vice president the chance to potentially make gaffes or policy commitments he might later regret.  But to critics, the president’s performance only highlighted his chaotic style of leadership, which has turned off many independent, suburban and female voters this election year.  “We have a white supremacist in the White House who cares only about himself, who says he is about law and order but, I can guarantee you, is coming into my community, disregarding the laws of health and safety for Minnesotans,” Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said ahead of the visit on a call with reporters. “He parses out core information about a coronavirus pandemic at a timeline that he thinks works best for him. I am not about him. I am about this community. I’m about the state, I am about this country, and I am about Joe Biden.”  Trump’s campaign advisers, allies and even the president himself have long viewed Minnesota in 2020 as a potential toss-up, thanks to Trump’s support among rural white, noncollege-educated voters.  The last time the state went for a Republican presidential candidate was in 1972, when President Richard Nixon won a second term. Since then, the state has reliably supported Democratic candidates for president, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain bastions of progressive politics.  In 2016, 19 counties outside of the Twin Cities went for Trump, even though those same counties had supported Barack Obama in prior elections — lending credence to the Trump campaign’s idea of the state as one of the new battlegrounds.  Recent polls show Biden up by anywhere from 6 to 16 points in the state. The presidential contest is much closer in other battleground states, such as Florida, North Carolina and Arizona, but the Trump campaign still sees an opening in the northeastern part of Minnesota as the president tries to sway both rural and union workers. Roughly one week ago, Trump held a rally in Bemidji, Minn.  During the rally on Wednesday, Trump tried to portray himself as an ally of miners and other union workers. Flanking the stage were two long trucks filled with logs and adorned with signs reading “Make Logging Great Again.” Two huge American flags hung from cranes, and Trump spoke about his support for miners and the iron range in Minnesota.  \"They closed it up,” the president said. “As vice president, Joe Biden wiped out, he wiped out so much and that includes what he whipped out in the great state of Minnesota and we’re not going to let it happen anymore.”  President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Duluth International Airport, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Duluth, Minn. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) | Alex Brandon/AP Photo  “But you know, they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have it,” Trump added. “After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the iron range came roaring back. But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I knocked out so many of the things that he did.”  Though Trump tried to take credit for saving steelworker jobs, both Obama and Trump took action to protect the steel industry from foreign steel dumping in the state. Obama implemented tariffs on Chinese steel, and most mines that were shuttered during a 2015 downturn reopened before Trump was elected, Minnesota Public Radio reported.  The president spent the first portion of the rally retelling his version of the story in which he triumphed in Tuesday\\'s debate over Biden, whom he sought to cast as a socialist.  “I’ve got news for Joe: If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison, I will tell you,” Trump said. “I know them all.”  “You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of his debates,” he added. “With those ratings, they’re never going to let him cancel. You don’t know television.”  Biden\\'s campaign has committed to participating the next debate “under whatever set of rules the Commission develops to try to contain Donald Trump\\'s behavior.” The Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Wednesday that it would be altering the format of the debates to better control the participants.  The rally in Duluth was uncommonly short, clocking just under an hour on stage, and it hit on many of Trump’s popular themes of law and order and his support from law enforcement groups; his recent pick for a Supreme Court seat; and immigration, falsely claiming Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wanted to flood the state with refugees and inundate the state’s schools and hospitals with immigrants.  “What are they going to do when in eight, 12, 16 more years we hang it up?” Trump said, talking about how boring he thought politics would be when he left, and giving fuel to the idea that he would potentially try to serve for more than the allowable two terms.

Pete Wilson has endorsed President Donald Trump. | J. Emilio Flores/Getty Images Pete Wilson endorses Trump, says president has \\'very good judgment\\'  OAKLAND — Former California Gov. Pete Wilson joined a list Thursday of prominent former Republican leaders who endorsed Donald Trump for reelection, arguing in an interview that the president has “brought a badly needed realism to American security policy.”  Wilson was among nearly seven dozen members of past GOP administrations and Congress who backed Trump in a signed letter that was released by the campaign Thursday and tweeted by the president with the words \"THANK YOU! #MAGA.\"  Trump “has very good judgment, and very good people around him making honest calls — and alerting him and the rest of the country to the fact that we are facing greater dangers than at any time since Ronald Reagan dealt with the Cold War,’’ Wilson explained to POLITICO Thursday.  The former Republican governor is often blamed for the state party\\'s woes among voters, especially now that Latino residents comprise a plurality of California\\'s population. While running for reelection in 1994, Wilson championed Proposition 187, then billed as a way to stop undocumented immigrants from accessing public services. Voters approved the initiative but it was blocked by courts — and is now a far cry from subsequent state policies enacted by Democratic leaders.  Despite Wilson\\'s legacy on immigration, he was often considered a social moderate in the latter 20th century, supporting abortion rights. And he positioned himself as a moderate Republican during his 1996 run for president — a tack different from Trump\\'s appeal to the party\\'s conservative base.  Wilson\\'s endorsement veers from positions taken by past prominent members of the California Republican establishment. Among them: 2010 gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman; 2010 U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina; and high-level strategist Steve Schmidt, who advised President George W. Bush, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain.  “I like many of these people, and they are personal friends ... and I\\'ve talked to enough of them to know that they don\\'t like his style,’’ Wilson said. But he advises them to “look at performance — look at what he’s actually achieved.’’  A former Marine, Wilson lauded Trump for his strong stand in support of Israel, and for his key role in the so-called Abraham Accords, the recently signed normalization agreement between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which he called historic.  Regarding threats to American security, including from countries like Iran and China, Wilson said Trump “has been tough as hell with them in terms of the actual policies that he has put in place.\"  Wilson also defended Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that if the president “had not as early as he did in late January’’ shut down flights from China, “it would have been a far worse situation ... and I don\\'t see how anybody can deny that.”  Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant who has worked with Wilson for years and counts him as a friend, said he was shocked by the former governor’s stance. Along with Schmidt and other prominent Republicans, Madrid is a founder of the Lincoln Project, a group of GOP strategists raising money and running ads against Trump.  “Gov. Wilson has always been very good to me. He helped me to get started in politics,\" Madrid said. \"But we’re at a moment where what is happening to this country is undeniable, and for the first time in my life — as someone who is Latino, who knows him personally and has admired him — I will say I’m disappointed in him.\"  Wilson \"is a fighter, a man of principle and he comes to his own opinions and always viewed as a leader ... but he just made Joe Biden’s Latino outreach effort a helluva lot easier,\" Madrid added.  Other Californians who joined Wilson on the list include Ric Grenell, the Fox News pundit who is Trump’s former ambassador to Germany and his former acting director of national security, and Edwin Meese, the former Alameda County district attorney who served as attorney general under President Ronald Reagan.  The letter backing Trump from 66 former GOP leaders comes less than a week after the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden released a letter announcing his endorsement by more than 500 national security experts. That letter, titled \"Our Fellow Citizens,\" was signed by 22 four-star officers, and charged that the “current president” is not up to “the enormous responsibilities of his office.\"  More than 70 top Republicans, who are national security officials, have also issued a letter calling Trump “dangerously unfit to serve.” Among those signing the letter were former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel; former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, and former CIA and FBI director William Webster.'}\n",

Sexual health experts say the lessons they’ve learned from both these triumphs and failures could make a major difference now in suppressing the coronavirus. Their insights suggest smart ways forward that might well cross party lines — including that you can\\'t fix a problem just with finger-wagging and new rules, but you can\\'t wish it away and move on with your life, either.  Here are the top lessons they’ve learned that could help battle the Covid-19 pandemic:  1. From condoms to masks, fear and shame don\\'t work.  Sexual health experts who have spent decades promoting condom use have some advice for their public health counterparts struggling to convince people to wear face masks: attempts to scare or shame people into compliance will backfire.  “When we tell people: ‘If you don’t like wearing a mask, you’re really not going to like a ventilator’ — those kinds of fear-based messages are not very effective,” said Julia Marcus, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in HIV prevention. “Even if there’s truth to them, they make people associate this simple intervention with sickness and death. Similarly, messages that have associated condoms with disease and death didn’t exactly make people hot to put them on in a moment of pleasure and intimacy.”  Marcus says officials should be aware that resistance to wearing condoms and resistance to wearing masks are driven by some of the same misperceptions about their effectiveness and insecurities about manliness. But there are ways to get around them. She pointed to videos produced by California’s health department that acknowledge and address head on some of the reasons people don’t wear masks — from concerns it telegraphs weakness to small annoyances like fogging up glasses and making it harder to read facial expressions — as an example of a more effective strategy.  Experts say mask campaigns should also emulate successful HIV prevention campaigns that appealed to people’s altruism, like one popular message developed a few years ago pushing HIV-positive people to adhere to their drug regimen to protect both themselves and their sexual partners.  As with condoms and HIV drugs, the most effective message is that masks don’t just protect us; they protect others. And that’s not getting across.  “It’s the notion that … you\\'re doing good for your fellow person and your community,” said Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health. “That\\'s completely lacking in the [mask] messaging right now.”  2. Abstinence is a fool’s errand.  Researchers who have watched decades of abstinence-only education fail to bring down the number of unintended pregnancies and STDs say the government should not counsel the Covid equivalent of abstinence — strict quarantines and social isolation.  “You need to give people safe ways to navigate the pandemic just like you need to give people safe ways to have sex,” Halkitis said. “If you don\\'t, people are going to develop mythological understandings of how biology operates so they can accommodate their needs and their desires.”  Not everybody can work remotely, many lack space in the home to keep separate from other family members, and long-term isolation can be emotionally crippling. So Halkitis and other STD experts say the government should instead adopt a “harm reduction” approach — one that helps people understand the spectrum of risk of different activities so they can make informed decisions. For instance: If you can stay home, stay home. If you can’t, stay six feet apart and wear a mask. Outdoors is safer than indoors. Small groups are better than large ones.  But so far, there’s been more of a black-and-white, all-or-nothing approach — reflected in language used by both Democrats and Republicans like “shutdown,” “lockdown” and “reopening” that doesn’t convey nuance. Jeanne Marrazzo, a physician and HIV and infectious diseases expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said a more empathetic and supportive approach from officials — i.e. “How can I help you stay safe?” — works better than a punitive tone that often leads to people doubling down on risky behavior.  “This approach of vilifying people who violate the rules has never worked,” she said. “It’s never worked for HIV or STDs or drug use, and it’s not working now for people having frat parties on college campuses.”  3. Testing needs to be free, convenient and routine or it will fail.  The U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic has been plagued by testing failures — from supply shortages to surprise medical bills to a dangerously inadequate effort to test those without symptoms — that have allowed the virus to spread far and wide.  These missteps could have been avoided, public health experts say, if the government had ensured from the beginning that testing was universally free, convenient and routine, and that it covered people regardless of whether they have symptoms.  “We realized way back in the 1960s and 70s that many, if not most, people [with STDs] were asymptomatic and to get ahead of the curve you had to find the people who had the highest risk and were most likely to transmit it,” said Cornelis Rietmeijer, the former head of Denver’s STD control program. “You have to do screening, not just diagnostic testing.”  Rietmeijer cited the hard-won battle that led to the CDC recommending in 2014 that all sexually active women under 25 be screened every year for chlamydia as an example of the kind of broad based strategy that works; STDs that don’t have the same level of routine testing, like syphilis, have seen epidemics.  “One of the things happening in the U.S. that’s a disaster is the increase in congenital syphilis,” he said, referring to an STD passed from a pregnant mother to her child. \"That’s something you usually only see in the third world. It\\'s totally preventable if women get tested in their first trimester.”  Other successful strategies include using mobile vans to bring testing to vulnerable neighborhoods and providing at-home testing kits — some of which allow people to swab themselves and mail the sample into a lab and others that deliver rapid results at home. Similar mail-in tests for Covid are becoming more available, and testing companies are trying to develop simple, instant at-home tests, like pregnancy tests. But while there are open questions about their accuracy, experts say the government should more aggressively pursue, perfect and promote this option.  \"Some people experience discomfort in clinical settings, while others say they just don’t know where to go to get tested,\" said Jen Hecht with the group Building Healthy Online Communities, which has researched how at-home HIV testing kits can expand access. “And at home, there’s no need to deal with anything related to transportation or taking time off work.”  4. Build trust with marginalized populations.  Like STDs, Covid has been far more prevalent among marginalized groups, including communities of color and the poor, who because of centuries of abuse and neglect by the medical system are often reluctant to come in for regular testing and treatment of infectious diseases — one reason they have disproportionate rates of both STDs and Covid-19.  Advocates and government officials have made some progress on tackling sexual health disparities by pushing local health departments to recruit and hire disease investigators who are from the communities they’re trying to reach, and to create messaging specifically tailored to minority groups — two actions they say aren’t happening enough during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In Arkansas, for example, immigrants from the Marshall Islands comprised nearly 20 percent of Covid-19 cases in two hard-hit counties although they made up only 1.5 percent of the population, according to a CDC team that flew in to investigate this summer. At the time, the state had only one contact tracer who spoke Marshallese, out of a team of 200, and its public health phone alerts were not available in that language.  But STD experts have learned that hiring bilingual public health workers and translating guidance isn’t enough. To build trust, it’s essential to have staff who have backgrounds that reflect the communities at highest risk of infection — such as LGBT people, immigrants, the formerly homeless and those recovering from addiction.  Marrazzo said she fears inadequate consultation with marginalized groups in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine will mean that the people who need it most won’t trust or take it if and when it becomes available. A poll conducted in late August found that 72 percent of Black Americans said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine when it’s available, compared to 49 percent of white respondents.  “The only way you’re going to get something that works for people is to involve them in the research from the beginning,” she said. “We learned that the hard way with sexual health and we’re making the same mistakes again now.”  5. Don’t stop something that’s working.  The U.S. has long been trapped in a dangerous cycle of ignoring and defunding public health programs during times of calm and only to throw money at a problem later when it becomes a crisis.  “It happened with tuberculosis in the 1960s and 70s,” recounted Rietmeijer. “When TB came under control, they dismantled all the clinics in New York City. Then it increased again and we were all caught with our pants down.”  More recently, states and the federal government invested heavily in global health and infectious disease prevention after 9/11 drew attention to bioterrorism threats, but that funding was gutted in the wake of the 2008 recession. It never recovered, allowing STD rates to soar and leaving the nation highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic.  “The lesson is that prevention works, but what tends to get defunded is prevention,” Halkitis said. “Putting the money in the front end, while costly, is going to save money in the long run. But we as a country totally suck at that.”  Leaders like former CDC Director Tom Frieden are lobbying for a permanent health security fund that operates outside of Congress’ normal budgetary dealings, so that funding isn’t approved only when a pandemic or other crisis is already underway.  As Covid-19 deaths level off at the still-high rate of around 1,000 per day, experts stress that it’s not too late to implement these strategies from the sexual health world and turn the tide of the pandemic. The real danger, they say, is to continue on the current path.  “People say public health has failed on sexually transmitted infections,” Rietmeijer said, citing the country’s current record rates of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia. “But I say, society has failed public health. We’ve let it go by the wayside. There\\'s been complacency when there is no urgency.”  This story is part of a reporting fellowship on health care performance sponsored by the Association of Health Care Journalists and supported by the Commonwealth Fund.'}\n",

Interested viewers could hear what the two candidates were saying. Disinterested viewers could flip the channel to baseball without worrying a bomb was about to go off.  If you think that’s not consequential, consider the despair that moderator Chris Wallace, the Commission on Presidential Debates and political professionals everywhere were thrust into following the debate between Trump and Joe Biden last week. The commission announced it was considering “additional structure” to “ensure a more orderly discussion.”  Maybe all they needed was to change the people on stage.  Here are some other takeaways from tonight\\'s vice presidential debate.  Pandemic response success is in the eye of the debater  Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing in April 2020. | Alex Wong/Getty Images  The most effective line of attack Democrats have against Trump is his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and Harris bludgeoned Pence for the White House’s halting and at-times chaotic response to the virus. To Harris, it is \"the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.” To Pence, it was an early intervention that saved lives.  The lines weren’t new. But the debate served as a reminder that the virus isn’t going anywhere in the final month of the campaign — and Pence seems to know it. Instead of dodging on the virus, he punched back, asserting that the administration will have a vaccine in “record time” and accusing Harris of working to “undermine public confidence in a vaccine.”  “Stop playing politics with people’s lives,” he said.  The problem for Pence is that the weight of public opinion is against him. More than 200,000 Americans have died from Covid-19. The pandemic is raging, with the president — himself infected — leaving the hospital only Monday. The White House has become a hot spot of infection. And if that wasn’t enough, Trump on Tuesday pulled out of negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over a pandemic relief package, deflating financial markets on his first day back.  If the in-person audience needed a reminder, the situation is so grave in Salt Lake City that debate coverage in the local newspaper this morning shared above-the-fold real estate with a story about the mayor urging reinstatement of some public health restrictions.  Pence the defender  Pence is better at this than Trump.  Whereas the president failed last week to make the debate about anything other than him, Pence knows how to pivot. And he did.  Asked if he believes climate change is an “existential threat,” Pence turned to taxes, criticizing Biden for proposing to cancel Trump-era tax cuts. He hit Harris and Biden on fracking and fossil fuels, saying a Biden administration would “crush” American jobs.  He accused Harris of being unacceptably liberal.  None of this may work, of course. This election is overwhelmingly a referendum on Trump, and the president is lagging badly for a reason. But Republicans will be a lot happier leaving a debate in which the focus wasn’t so lopsidedly on the president.  What Trump needed from Pence on Wednesday is what he got — a calm explanation to Republicans and right-leaning independents that a Trump-Pence ticket, however chaotic, also comes with the conservative policies they care about.  Pence resets debate with a focus on the Supreme Court  Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\\'s pick to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s seat on the Supreme Court. | Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via AP  The best thing Pence did for Republicans on Wednesday night was to refocus attention on the Supreme Court — and pummel Harris for refusing to say if she and Biden will support expanding the court if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed.  This was no easy task. Trump’s hospitalization — and the infections of Republicans around him — had turned the public attention on Barrett’s nomination away from the court and to an epidemiological study of the Rose Garden event that kicked it off.  But Pence pushed past that.  “I think the American people really deserve an answer,” he said. When Harris repeatedly dodged, Pence spoke directly to the camera, saying, “The straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election.”  Republicans believe highlighting Barrett could energize base voters and persuade conservative-leaning independents to get over their reservations about Trump’s temperament or other aspects of his job performance.  On the line is a case to undercut the Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court will hear one week after Election Day, as well as the composition of a court that may be called on to settle election-related disputes.  Harris criticized Pence for the administration’s efforts to undo health care protections and on Democrats’ concerns about what Barrett’s confirmation could mean for Roe v. Wade. But what will be remembered from the Supreme Court conversation is the Biden-Harris ticket’s unwillingness to answer on a Supreme Court expansion.  Harris is tightly scripted in big moments  Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. | Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images  It was bad enough when Trump refused to condemn white supremacists last week, instead telling the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.”  It was devastating for the Trump-Pence ticket watching Harris remind the country of it.  This wasn’t Trump, Biden or Chris Wallace — three other white, male septuagenarians — on stage with the Pence. It was Harris who, if elected, will be the first Black vice president.  Harris was on and off during the debate, and Pence edged in more often than she did. But Harris was effective on the coronavirus and powerful on race.  The former prosecutor said she would “not be lectured to” by Pence about issues of law and order and criminal justice. She and Pence were talking, she said, about a president, during last week’s debate, “refused to condemn white supremacists.”  Pence shook his head and said, “Not true.” But it was. Millions of Americans saw it for themselves.  Harris got in trouble in the primary when she went off script — or didn’t have one.  Back in 2018, she said “it depends,” when asked at a town hall meeting if she would reject donations from corporations or corporate lobbyists, then changed course within weeks and electing not to take corporate PAC money. During the primary, she struggled to express how, exactly, she planned to address health care — with the Biden campaign dismissing the proposal she came up with as a “have-it-every-which-way” plan.  But Harris’ plans are now Biden’s. And when Harris is prepared — as her performance in the debate demonstrated — she can be very good.  Life — and death — is a stage  Protective plastic panels stand onstage between tables for Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris at the University of Utah on Tuesday in Salt Lake City. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo  If the first 15 minutes of a debate are the most important, the opening scene on Wednesday wasn’t good for the Trump-Pence ticket.  Susan Page, the moderator, described the “extra precautions” taken to avoid spreading the coronavirus, including plexiglass separating the two candidates, clear reminder to viewers of the Trump administration’s inability to control the coronavirus pandemic, even inside the White House.  Of course, that was a round Harris won before the debate even started. Pence had objected to such a barrier before caving, and it was a gross miscalculation. The controversy generated a flurry of coverage, and the barriers when up, anyway.  It’s not a conversation the Trump-Pence ticket wants to have. And if Pence — who has so far tested negative for Covid-19 — couldn’t stop organizers from putting stricter public health measures in place, it’s hard to see how Trump, who just left the hospital with the virus, will be able to do any better if either of the two remaining presidential debates go forward.  Pence affixes himself to Trump  President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrive at a campaign rally in Sept. 2020 in Newport News, Va. | Steve Helber/AP Photo  History suggests Wednesday’s vice presidential debate almost certainly won’t affect the outcome of this election. But it might have offered a preview of the next one.  Pence put zero daylight between himself and the president. He evaded a question about Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, saying he would have confidence in the outcome if it is “free and fair.” He said support for Trump had only grown in four years, that the media unfairly “selectively edit” the president, and that he “couldn’t be more proud” to stand with Trump.  It might not matter. Trump still has a grasp on the Republican Party, and the attachment may serve Pence well. Sure, he can be boring. But who knows what Republicans will be in the mood for personality-wise in four years. Pence’s approval ratings among Republicans are solid, and he has support among Christian conservatives.  But if Trump loses big, Pence may have a trouble. In past appearances, he has at least nodded to some differences with the president, saying at the Republican National Convention this summer, for example, that Trump “does things his own way, on his own terms.”  Pence produced nothing on Wednesday that he will be able to point back to four years from now as evidence of at least some separation.  And it is possible that Pence and Harris will be sharing a stage once again. Regardless of whether Biden or Trump wins, Harris will likely be an immediate frontrunner in the next open Democratic presidential primary, whether in 2024 or 2028.  The polite thing to say is that he’s steady, if at times boring. But who knows what Republicans will be in the mood for personality-wise after four or eight years of Trump. His approval ratings among Republicans are solid, and he has support among Christian conservatives.'}\n",

TALLAHASSEE — Buoyed by promised ad buys, new hires and Joe Biden's visit on Tuesday to Kissimmee — home to a sizable Puerto Rican population — Florida Democrats are growing more confident of the party’s chances with Hispanic voters as Election Day approaches.  Florida Democrats haven’t been shy about launching attacks at their own candidate and party leadership as Biden and Donald Trump remain neck and neck in the battleground state. But that tune is changing after Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, made a stop in Miami last week and Biden chose Kissimmee for his first in-person campaign appearance.  In Kissimmee, a city outside Orlando and the epicenter of the state’s Puerto Rican vote, Biden planned to outline a wide-ranging plan to help Puerto Rico, an island battered in recent years by natural disasters and economic instability.  He wants to make it easier for Puerto Rico to get federal assistance after years of fighting with the Trump administration for help in the wake of devastating natural disasters, boost payments to the island’s Medicare Advantage System and expand coronavirus services.  Biden has not endorsed statehood, which is among the biggest issues for Puerto Rican voters.  “They have woken up and smelled the café con leche,” said state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Miami Democrat and persistent critic of her party’s Hispanic outreach. “It’s absolutely not too late. I’ve been happy they are taking note.”  For years, the political fight for Florida’s Hispanic vote has centered on South Florida, home to huge patchwork of Hispanic voters, including conservative-leaning Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. That focus is starting to shift to Central Florida, where more than 1 million Democratic-leaning Puerto Ricans have become a powerful voting block that has helped offset conservative Cuban voters. Florida’s complex Hispanic electorate now makes up 17 percent of all registered voters.  “We are going to have a full-court press in the Central Florida region,” Biden campaign adviser Christian Ulvert said. “The Puerto Rican vote is critical, and the campaign is going to work hard to earn every one of their votes.”  Following Biden’s appearance Tuesday, big-name surrogates are expected to blanket the Orlando media market, a large and critical portion of the coveted Interstate 4 corridor, in the weeks leading up to Election Day.  “Nothing is perfect, there are always bumps in the road, and we are starting to straighten them out. Is everyone happy? No,” said state Sen. Victor Torres, who is of Puerto Rican descent and represents an Orlando-area seat. “But we are getting there. It is getting worked out and they are trying to make it correct.”  Biden’s late-hour attempt to reverse public perception of his Hispanic outreach comes amid a withering drumbeat of criticism from the Trump campaign and Florida Republicans, who are casting Democrats and Biden as socialist-sympathizing extremists who support leftist Latin American strongmen.  “Joe Biden is a wholly owned subsidiary of the radical left socialist agenda,” said Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, a prominent Trump campaign Hispanic surrogate, on a campaign call Tuesday afternoon. “Biden would strengthen Cuba’s brutal regime, which would make it easier to prop up other regimes” such as Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.  Biden almost certainly will win the Hispanic vote in Florida, but in a state where the past two presidential elections have been decided by less than a single point, margins matter.  A poll earlier this month found Biden’s advantage among Hispanic voters at 53-37, much smaller than the 27-point margin Hillary Clinton claimed in 2016 when she narrowly lost Florida to Trump.  Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who runs Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, doubts that Biden can replicate Clinton’s margins in Hispanic-heavy Miami-Dade County, but Biden might not have to reach Clinton-level numbers to win the state.  The Clintons had 30 years of relationship-building in Miami and Bill Clinton was one of the first Democrats to actively campaign for the Cuban vote, Schale wrote in a memo outlining Florida’s 2020 landscape. “Republicans and Trump have had four years of outreach work.”  Trump is unlikely to replicate his massive wins with white older and suburban voters, so Biden won’t have to win the same share of the Hispanic vote as Clinton did in 2016, Schale wrote.  Taddeo, who as recently as last week was critical of Biden’s Hispanic outreach, said the campaign has woken up just in time to a potential trap that could once again cost the party Florida’s 29 electoral votes.  Biden’s visit on Tuesday builds on excitement over a $100 million ad pledge from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a portion of which will target Hispanic voters throughout the state. Detailed plans for the commitment have been kept under wraps, but the ad campaign will focus on Hispanic turnout.  “The café con leche is getting whipped cream on top with the millions that Bloomberg will spend specifically on Hispanic voters,” Taddeo said in an interview as she drove to do Spanish-language audio work for the Bloomberg effort.  “My understanding is that it will be spent on ground and digital,” said a person familiar with early planning for the nine-figure spend. “Bloomberg people are very data-driven. No one will receive money without proof of ability to perform.”  Bloomberg’s money will bolster Biden’s paid media advantage in the Miami market and Spanish-language ads across the state. Biden so far has spent $11 million in the Miami market and $1.7 million on Spanish-language ads.  Trump has spent $10.9 million in Miami and $800,170 on Spanish-language ads, according to Advertising Analytics.  Still, Biden needs to overcome a multiyear effort by Florida Republicans to brand Democrats as extremist socialists, messaging that has been given a signal boost by the Trump campaign.  State Rep. Javier Fernández of South Miami, a Democrat running in a competitive Florida Senate seat, said the branding effort has been under way for years. The GOP-dominated Florida Legislature, for example, in 2019 passed legislation to ban sanctuary cities despite the fact that no Florida municipalities have laws protecting illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement.  “The consistency and message discipline have long been there. That’s what has made it effective,” Fernandez said. “In Tallahassee, [the Republican majority] have chosen issues to highlight extremism and rule of law. Sanctuary cities are a good example of one of those calculated wedge issues.”  “Joe Biden is not a Trojan horse for the liberal left, which is a growing sub-narrative,” he said. “He is going to act within his own belief system.”\"}\n",

POLITICO reporters from across the country break down what it will take for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to win over the most critical voters.  In 2016, white voters cast over 80 percent of the vote in each of the three states, according to exit polls.  “It’s a big, big swing,” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “What [Biden’s] doing among whites is more than offsetting the slippage among nonwhites … The recipe is very different this time, right now anyway, in terms of white voters.”  It’s possible the focus on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s replacement will help Trump, reminding voters who have drifted away from him what they cared about in 2016. Four years ago, one in five voters — many of them white, social conservatives — said Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor in their vote.  But Trump is working from a disadvantage this year. There are relatively few undecided voters left to persuade. Democrats are also highly energized about the Supreme Court. And Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the court one month before the midterm elections two year ago did nothing to stop Democrats from steamrolling Trump and the GOP.  The erosion of Trump’s white support — and its significance to the November outcome — was never more obvious than in Trump’s messaging in recent days. Last week, he called for the creation of a commission to promote “patriotic education,” while dismissing “critical race theory” and the 1619 project of The New York Times Magazine. At a rally in Mosinee, Wis., he lit into Kamala Harris — the first major party woman of color vice presidential nominee — lamenting the possibility of her becoming president “through the back door.”  On Friday, he released a TV ad in Minnesota and Michigan lashing into Biden for supporting increased refugee admissions, including from “the most unstable, vulnerable, dangerous parts of the world.” Then, before an overwhelmingly white crowd in Bemidji, Minn., Trump mocked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — the first Somali-American in Congress and a former refugee — and said Biden would “turn Minnesota into a refugee camp.”  He praised Minnesotans for their “good genes.”  But Trump’s rhetoric does not appear to be resonating with white America to the degree it did in 2016. That year, whites cast nearly three-quarters of the vote nationally, and Trump won those voters by about 15 percentage points, according to Pew Research. Four years later, Biden has torn into that advantage, though to what degree is uncertain. The latest Morning Consult poll showed Trump now beating Biden among white likely voters nationally by just 5 percentage points. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday put Trump up among white voters by 9 percentage points, while a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll on Friday showed Biden and Trump essentially tied with white voters.  Anywhere in that range is a problem for Trump. It is a major reason why Biden, despite underperforming with voters of color, is still running ahead nationally.  “Suburban whites are pretty much gone” for Trump, said Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and former chair of the Democratic National Committee. And Biden is far less objectionable to many working-class whites than Clinton, a more polarizing nominee whose favorability ratings were lower than Biden’s.  “If Trump loses Pennsylvania by 4 or 5 points,” Rendell said, “then the suburbs and the working-class whites, that accounts for the loss.”  Trump is doing better with whites in some states than others. In North Carolina, he is drawing noncollege-educated white voters at about the same levels he was in 2016. But in other states, including some with sizable populations of people of color, he is underperforming with whites. In Florida, Trump is running ahead of Biden with white voters 56 percent to 39 percent, according to a Monmouth University poll. But that is far short of the 32 percentage-point margin he posted in 2016. In Arizona, he has seen his 14-point edge with white voters in 2016 cut as well.  It wasn’t always clear Trump would have any problem with white voters — or that he would be making gains with people of color. Even in the midterm elections, when suburbanites recoiled from Trump and Democrats retook the House, Republicans carried the white vote nationally by about 10 percentage points.  But white voters have not proved immune to the damage inflicted on Trump by the coronavirus and its resulting economic wreckage, which have been a drag on Trump’s reelection campaign since spring. In particular, the pandemic appears to have hurt Trump with seniors, including older white voters concerned about both their retirement accounts and their health.  “It’s these older white voters that I think are the ones that are moving” away from Trump, said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa-based Democratic strategist who has studied voters who turned from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. “The older people are like, ‘What the f--- is this guy doing?\\'”  Earlier this year, Trump appeared to have an opening to recapture white support. Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis — and the ensuing protests across the country — Trump pivoted to a law-and-order campaign, with overt appeals to suburban whites. But the effort has largely fallen flat, with numerous polls suggesting the turmoil was doing little to improve Trump’s prospects.  And the issue that motivated many white voters in 2016 — immigration, amplified by Trump’s promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — has all but fallen out of view. During his successful presidential campaign, 13 percent of voters ranked immigration as the most important issue facing the country. Last month, immigration barely registered at 2 percent in Gallup’s survey of the most important problems facing the country.  Pat McCrory, the former Republican governor of North Carolina, said he has been “very surprised” that the Trump campaign has not leaned more heavily into immigration, particularly around Biden’s past statements about health care for undocumented immigrants.  But with the coronavirus and months of civil unrest on the electorate’s mind, “the two moving factors [in the election] may be the violence and the virus: The two V’s. Both parties are throwing ads and mail out on those two issues.” McCrory said, “There does seem to be a little flip” between Biden and Trump, with Biden courting working-class whites and Trump “actually trying to go after the Black vote, and the Hispanic vote.”  Appearing at a town hall last week in his childhood home of Scranton, Pa., a city that is more than 80 percent white, Biden cited his “Scranton roots” in an appeal to the working class, saying he was accustomed to people deriding those “who look at us and think that we\\'re suckers, look at us and they think that we don\\'t — we\\'re not equivalent to them.”  Not only do public safety-based appeals appear to be faltering for Trump, white voters “still really care about pocketbook issues, and that is the underlying issue that drives their vote,” said Zak Williams, a Democratic mail strategist based in Duluth, Minn., near where Biden campaigned Friday.  “College-educated white voters were the first group that moved away from him,” Williams said, and now Trump is “starting to drive away noncollege-educated white voters,” too.  At the center of Trump’s reelection math has always been the expectation that he could turn out more white, noncollege-educated voters in 2020 than he did in 2016, squeezing more juice from a diminishing base. Nick Trainer, the Trump campaign\\'s director of battleground strategy, said \"the vast majority of polls are oversampling Democrats and are relying on an outdated sampling formula.\"  Weekly Score Your guide to the year-round campaign cycle.

Trainer acknowledged Trump \"has room to improve his numbers with certain voters, including suburban women and voters who disliked both candidate Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.\" However, he said \"sustained preelection attacks on issues we know these voters care about will hurt Joe Biden and boost President Trump.\"  Even if the result is a margin of victory with noncollege-educated white voters that is smaller than it was four years ago, Trump will almost certainly carry that group. And if he can turn them out in greater numbers, he could shift the electorate toward him in several predominantly white states. Republicans and Democrats alike estimate there are hundreds of thousands of unregistered, noncollege-educated whites in key swing states that Trump could still pick up.  That fight for those voters was on display in Minnesota on Friday, where Trump and Biden appeared not in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs, but in more culturally conservative, northern reaches of the state. Republicans there and in some of the whitest counties in the country say they haven’t seen any falloff for Trump, and many of them suspect that polls are still underrepresenting his support.  Stephanie Soucek, chair of the Republican Party in Wisconsin’s Door County said she sees more Trump signs in her county than she did in 2016. Jack Brill, acting chair of the local Republican Party in Sarasota County, Fla., said “the base in Sarasota County is as strong as ever.”  In Duluth, the target of much attention from the Trump campaign, the city’s former mayor, Gary Doty, acknowledged that the president may have shed some support among some white women because of “the way he presents himself. He’s sometimes crude and rude, and I don’t care for that style.”  However, he said, “I think there’s this silent group of people” who support Trump and will turn out for him.  Doty said that after he endorsed Trump recently, “people that wouldn’t talk to me about politics … after they heard I had supported the Trump ticket, would come say, ‘Hey, I’m for him, too.\\'\"  '}\n",

POLITICO reporters from across the country break down what it will take for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to win over the most critical voters.  There’s little question Biden’s foreign policy would look and feel a lot different than Trump’s. The former vice president speaks often about restoring alliances, promoting human rights and standing up to dictators — themes you don’t often hear from Trump. In his convention speech, Biden vowed to “work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.”  Understandably, Biden tends to say less about the Trump policies he’d keep. His campaign would reveal only that his “focus is going to be on rebuilding America’s standing in the world and undoing the incredible damage Donald Trump has wreaked.”  Still, based on talks with a half-dozen people in and around the Biden campaign, here are some ways in which U.S. foreign policy may not change all that much if Trump loses to Biden in November.  A tougher tone  Trump has taken a bullying tone toward many countries, including some allies he’s accused of freeloading. “Angela, you owe me $1 trillion,” he’s reported to have once said to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, misstating the financial underpinnings of the NATO military alliance.  While Biden is not likely to be so crude, don’t be surprised if he at times takes a more forceful position toward both allies and adversaries than he did when he served as Barack Obama’s vice president.  The obvious top target for this tone is an adversary China, which itself has taken a more bellicose attitude toward the United States in recent months.  Unlike Trump, Biden probably won’t use terms like “China virus,” which have offended many Asians amid the coronavirus pandemic. But he appears to have laid aside his past hopes that increased global engagement would nudge China toward democracy. Biden once said “a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large.” More recently, he’s called Chinese leader Xi Jinping a “thug,” accused China’s leaders of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims and pledged to rally countries to hold China accountable for its economic “cheating.”  Biden also is likely to keep up the pressure on allies, including Germany, when it comes to defense spending. Obama’s first Defense secretary, Robert Gates, bluntly warned NATO in a 2011 speech of “the real possibility for a dim, if not dismal future for the trans-Atlantic alliance.” U.S. pressure led to a 2014 deal in which NATO members agreed to strive for the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024.  Trump’s harsh rhetoric on the topic — he’s privately threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO — might even give Biden more room to push the issue while still presenting himself as a welcome alternative to Trump. And how much other NATO members spend on defense could be a particularly salient issue if Biden bows to demands from progressives to cut U.S. defense spending.  The removal of Trump as an irritant could expose the fact that certain trans-Atlantic differences of opinion go well beyond the current occupant of the Oval Office. Germany, for one, has been reluctant to sign up for across-the-board confrontation with China, which has become a major trading partner. Many European countries also rely on Russia for energy supplies, so they tread carefully in dealings with Moscow.  Trump’s overt hostility toward multilateral institutions could present Biden with an opportunity to push through reforms to some international bodies. That includes the World Health Organization, which Trump has moved to quit, and the World Trade Organization, which is increasingly dysfunctional thanks to U.S. decisions.  Another example: Trump quit the U.N. Human Rights Council on the grounds that it was too focused on Israel and that its members include notoriously abusive governments. Instead of simply reinstating its support for the council, Biden could engage it while echoing Trump’s criticisms to push for reforms.  Biden also wants to host a summit for the world’s democracies. Such a gathering is an obvious slap at Trump, who has praised many dictators. But it’s also an implicit challenge to bodies like the U.N. Security Council, where autocracies like China and Russia often block U.S. initiatives. The idea recalls a proposal once pushed by late Republican Sen. John McCain, who called for establishing a “league of democracies” during the 2008 presidential campaign.

Sanctions and tariffs, which don’t necessarily require congressional action, are among the president’s favorite sticks. He has relied on both to unusual degrees to pursue his agenda on everything from trade to the imprisonment of Americans overseas.  Expect Biden to keep many of these penalties in place.  Trump’s tariffs on China would give Biden some leverage over an increasingly hostile Beijing, and he has hinted he might keep at least some during the initial months of his presidency. Although Biden has described Trump’s use of tariffs as “shortsighted,” he’s also asserted: “I will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy — a plan — to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness.”  The tariffs “could come off, but no administration is likely to remove them without getting something in return,” said Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security.  Other Trump policies toward China, including technology restrictions and limits on the movements of its diplomats in the United States, also could be here to stay. Given the increasingly widespread and bipartisan desire in Washington to stand up to China’s communist government, Biden could face blowback for moves that could be portrayed as soft on Beijing.  The Trump administration also has imposed economic and visa sanctions against an array of individuals. Biden might decide to remove some of those sanctions, such as the ones targeting officials with the International Criminal Court; but he’s likely to keep many of the so-called Magnitsky sanctions Trump has imposed on individuals overseas for corruption and human rights abuses.  “He may not have agreed with some of the steps put in place by Trump, but now that they are in place, he’s not going to lift them wholesale without thinking through what he might be able to get for lifting them,” one former U.S. ambassador said about Biden.  Immigration is a particularly tricky area. Trump has put in place unusually stringent limits on people seeking to come to the U.S., including severely lowering the number of refugees and outright banning immigrants from some countries. Biden has pledged to reverse these and many other Trump immigration policies.  But if Biden wants to strike a comprehensive immigration reform deal with Republicans, it could help to keep at least some of the changes made under Trump. One obvious possibility: Successful enhancements to security procedures designed to keep out potential terrorists. Another possibility: New rules that make it harder for foreigners to come to America to give birth to children who would then have U.S. citizenship — so-called birth tourism.  At times, it appears Biden is trying to walk a fine line on immigration. He’s said, for instance, that he won’t tear down the existing portion of a wall Trump has built along the southern border, but that he won’t add to it. Instead, he’s pledged to pursue more technologically advanced ways to secure the boundary.  Hard to reverse  A few Trump-era moves would be politically and practically hard to jettison.  Biden already has said he won’t reverse Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize that city as the Israeli capital. Biden has said relocating the embassy again won’t help the dormant peace process between Israelis and Palestinians. He has, however, pledged to reopen the U.S. Consulate that dealt with the Palestinians, which Trump shut down.  Biden also is unlikely to re-recognize Nicolas Maduro as president of Venezuela.  Trump dropped official U.S. recognition of Maduro in January 2019, instead recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Going back on all that would be … awkward. Besides, disdain for Maduro — a dictator who has overseen the economic ruin of his country — is widespread in Washington and among U.S. allies in Latin America.  Biden probably will tweak the overall U.S. policy toward Venezuela somewhat, possibly to encourage more dialogue between the opposition and the Maduro regime. Democrats also have criticized how little attention Trump has paid to humanitarian suffering and refugee flows from Venezuela and Central America. A Biden administration will likely try to address the problem.  Trump didn’t feel encumbered by international agreements made by his predecessor; he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal despite the advice of some of his top aides. Iran, in response, has taken steps to restart its nuclear program, making it harder for Biden to achieve his stated goal of rejoining the deal.  Take the deal  The Trump administration negotiated an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Biden has already said he supports the USMCA. He also will likely hang on to Trump’s “phase one” trade deal with China, though that pact is fragile.  Overall, a President Biden is expected to show much more skepticism toward trade deals than he has before in his decadeslong political career. That skepticism also aligns him, to some degree, with Trump, though for different reasons.  Trump has long been convinced that both allies and adversaries have been ripping off the United States in trade deals. Biden, under pressure from progressives, says he wants to pursue trade deals that don’t exacerbate economic inequality. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership; Biden has been coy about whether he’d rejoin that massive pact, which he once championed, saying he’d want to renegotiate parts of it.  Biden campaign officials say they want to focus first on the domestic economic recovery, in a nod to the difficult political climate for launching any new trade deals right now. But the Trump administration is currently negotiating trade agreements with Britain and Kenya; if Biden wins and those deals are unfinished, he’ll have to decide whether to pursue them or put them on hiatus.  Why not build on it?  Obama wanted to leave Afghanistan. Trump wants to leave Afghanistan. And Biden also wants to leave Afghanistan. So expect the Biden team to look for ways to maintain peace talks with the Taliban, who, under Trump, have agreed to a deal that is still being implemented.  The details, though, could derail the agreement. Biden, for instance, wants to keep a small number of U.S. troops in the country to battle terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The Taliban want all U.S. and NATO troops out.  Events on the ground could also force Biden’s hand. As it makes peace plans with the U.S., the Taliban has continued to battle with forces loyal to the Afghan government, which remains fragmented and divided over how best to end the country’s internal conflict.  Even if the current deal falls apart, a Biden administration will likely try to keep the channels open to strike a new agreement. The Trump-era deal could offer a template to build upon.  In fact, one person close to the Biden campaign said it’s possible that if he wins, he may ask Trump’s envoy to the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, to stick around for a few months to help the new administration find its footing with the Taliban.  When asked about this possibility during a recent call with reporters, Khalilzad said it was too soon to discuss the idea, but that he was committed to staying at least until November’s election.  Biden also has said he wants to build on a push by the Trump administration to get Arab countries to normalize their relations with Israel.  Earlier this month, representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House ceremony to sign pledges to establish diplomatic, economic and other ties. It was a historic moment, and one Biden applauded.  “A Biden-Harris administration will build on these steps, challenge other nations to keep pace,” Biden pledged.  He added a caveat, though, saying his administration would use the momentum to “leverage these growing ties into progress toward a two-state solution and a more stable, peaceful region.”  Trump’s approach to these agreements has made scant mention of the Palestinians, and put zero emphasis on the idea of a two-state solution. Biden’s desire to make a two-state solution a goal of the normalization push will no doubt complicate things, not least because the Israeli right wing would fight it.

A narrator notes Kind missed 138 votes in the last 2.5 years. The ad will air in the La Crosse and Wausau markets.  The decision to go into Kind’s district is notable because new offensive targets have proved rare this cycle for Republicans, who face an increasingly narrow path back to the majority. And they have been pushed into a defensive crouch by Democrats, who have recently made buys targeting deep red seats in Montana, Michigan, Alaska and Colorado.  The GOP initially struggled to find a strong contender to take on Kind. Van Orden, a retired Navy SEAL-turned-author, did not file to run until mid-March of this year and said he decided to do so after Kind voted for the articles of impeachment against Trump.  “The concerted effort Republicans put into recruiting top-tier candidates has allowed us to push deeper into the offensive opportunities some thought might be out of reach this cycle,” CLF President Dan Conston said in a statement.  The group’s internal data from this summer found Trump is still leading Biden in the district, and that a majority of voters want their member of Congress to back the president’s agenda. The generic congressional ballot favors a Republican candidate  President Barack Obama won the seat, which spans the western and southwestern swaths of the state, by 11 points in 2012. Trump won it by nearly 5 points four years later. It is predominantly white and largely rural.  Van Orden is not well-known but has proved a solid fundraiser, and he outraised the incumbent by a 2 to 1 margin in the second quarter. He is already on TV with an ad that links Kind to Pelosi and warns that Kind supports giving stimulus checks to illegal immigrants.  Still, Kind has a formidable cash-on-hand advantage, having banked nearly $3.1 million by late July, compared to Van Orden’s $288,000. The congressman has booked nearly $1.8 million in the district. His opponent has reserved about $1 million, according to data from Advertising Analytics.  No other outside groups have booked air time in the district.'}\n",

Their families and communities never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008. They are the hollowed-out middle class who see no future for their families: 90 percent of Americans born in the 1940s out-earned their parents, but only 50 percent of those born in the 1980s will. These folks are the other 50 percent. They are not the poorest Americans; they’re the fragile or formerly middle class living in economically depressed counties. Their deep demoralization is epitomized by the opioid crisis—never mentioned in the Democratic convention (perhaps we missed it?).  Overlooking these voters could jeopardize Democrats’ ability to win the swing states—Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan—that delivered the election to Donald Trump in 2016 by fewer than 80,000 votes because of the peculiarities of the Electoral College. “Rust Belt Revolt” voters in these states included not just the non-college educated whites who swung hard for Trump, but also Black voters whose turnout declined by the double digits, according to sociologist Michael McQuarrie.  We both believe that Democrats have these voters’ interests at heart, and that Trump does not. But Democrats need to say it, early, loud and incessantly. How should they do that?  Some Democrats have gotten distracted about whether the party should be talking about race or class. And it might seem as though they face an either/or decision between their diverse, identity-motivated constituency and the class-based message required to reach blue-collar voters whom Trump has hurt. But the reality is they don’t have to choose. Instead they must address the economic concerns of working-Americans—of all races—while also calling out Republicans’ attempts to divide Americans based on race.  We know this because in 2018, the progressive group Rural Organizing surveyed 820 rural Americans to test the power of the following message: “Instead of delivering for working people, politicians hand kickbacks to their donors who send jobs overseas. Then they turn around and blame new immigrants or people of color, to divide and distract us from the real source of our problems.” Note the three elements: 1) Americans of all races need good-paying jobs; 2) politicians have let the donor class gut Americans’ standard of living; 3) then they try to deflect the blame onto immigrants or people of color. In the survey, three-quarters of rural respondents agreed with this message, which appealed not just to liberal voters (who made up only 23 percent of the respondents), but also to the 42 percent who were conservatives and the 26 percent who were moderates.  Critical race scholar Ian Haney López calls this kind of messaging the race-class narrative, and he argues that it is critical to reaching the 59 percent of American voters he calls the “persuadables.” López, along with messaging consultant Anat Shenker-Osorio and pollster Celinda Lake, document that race-class messaging is more convincing among persuadables than “colorblind economic populism”—that is, messaging that invokes class alone. Crucially for Democrats, these scholars have found that white, Black and Latino persuadable voters all find race-class narratives more convincing than color-blind populism, by similar margins.  We can expect a significant subset of Trump voters to be receptive to a race-class message. A 2017 study by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group found that about one-fifth of Trump voters have bipartisan voting habits and warm feelings toward racial minorities. The study calls these voters “anti-elites,” and they present a major opportunity for Democrats: 83 percent of them think the economic system is biased in favor of the wealthiest Americans, and 68 percent of them favor raising taxes on the rich.  Democrats often get tarred as the party of elites because their positions in the culture wars clash with those of blue-collar Americans, especially whites and Latinos, who tend to place a high value on self-discipline and the traditional institutions that anchor it, notably religion, the military and “family values.” Republican politicians naturally want to keep attention focused there. But Democrats should focus on making the affirmative case that their party understands voters’ economic aspirations and economic pain much better than the GOP.  None of this means Democrats will need to retreat from their reputation as the party of diversity and inclusivity. As vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris has persistently pointed out, the economic pain so prevalent today falls on many Americans, from young Black men without jobs in cities, to middle-aged white men on disability or opioids, to women of all races stuck in underpaid dead-end “essential” jobs, to gig workers trying to make ends meet, to young adults still living in their parents’ basements. There’s enough economic pain to go around that it should be a central unifying issue for Joe Biden’s campaign going forward. Democrats need to commit to bringing economic opportunity to Americans of all education levels and every region of the country. That’s why one of us, who represents Silicon Valley in Congress, has teamed up with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) to bring Silicon Valley companies and investors to cities in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. That’s the right message for Democrats.  Why is this so urgent? Biden’s margin in crucial swing states is razor thin. Pollster Stanley Greenberg has found that in the last two weeks before the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton talked about the contrast between her and Trump’s economic policies and the changes she would bring, she consolidated her lead. Clinton’s largest lead was during the debates, when she hit Trump on the economy; afterward, she talked much less about the economy. Famously, Bill Clinton reportedly begged to be allowed to go to the Rust Belt but wasn’t. Let’s not make that kind of mistake again.  Biden appears not to be making the same mistake. Even during the pandemic, he has traveled to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where he pushed a “promises made, promises broken” theme, saying: “Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost jobs even before Covid hit. What about offshoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping American jobs overseas? You already know the answer. Of course not.”  We hope to see a lot more of this in the coming weeks. It should be dead easy for Biden to connect with America’s “anti-elite” voters. He was born to an economically precarious family in blue-collar Scranton. He already knows what he needs to do: Signal “I see you, I value you, and I will deliver for your family and your community. Hard work should pay off for hardworking Americans—Black, white and brown.” Then, he must explain concretely how Democrats will make sure hard work pays off—and Republicans won’t.'}\n",

It’s likely to accomplish nothing. Likewise, the federal grant “to support the development of a pro-American curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation’s great history” that he talked about at the National Archives Museum will likely achieve nothing concrete.  In attempting to place his personal, political mark on what children learn in schools, Trump is no originator. In a fine survey piece this week by Olivia B. Waxman in Time, we learn that the political quarrel over the past—what the history textbooks should say, which accounts are elevated and which suppressed in the classroom, who composes curricula—has been contested in every generation since the Civil War. The historical is the political. For all the anxiety Trump’s foray into classroom history is stirring up among horrified liberals, the only real surprise is how late he arrived on the field.  That doesn’t mean Trump’s speech was an exercise in futility. It expanded his usual attack on the press by essentially accusing the New York Times of the political corruption of our youth. Said Trump, “This project rewrites American history to teach our children that we were founded on the principle of oppression, not freedom.” It also aligned Trump against teachers—few of whom were going to vote for him anyway—and the educational establishment, once mocked by Trump’s spiritual godfather George Wallace, who liked to refer to “pointy-head college professors who can’t even park a bicycle straight.”  Since the earliest days of his presidency, Trump has sought to pit the “us” of himself and his crowd of cheering supporters against a nebulous “they”—that ever-expanding list of his enemies and foes, including but not limited to immigrants, the “deep state,” Democrats, reporters, note-takers in meetings, judges who defy him, residents of blue states, the makers of dishwashers, Mitt Romney, the Washington establishment, Muslims, his critics, the Chinese, former Cabinet members, whistleblowers and practically anybody who contradicts him. Trump stirs up and harnesses human animus better than any of his contemporaries, and it’s just like him to construct a fraudulent line of association that links rioting anarchists to revisionist historians to establishment journalists and finally to the educational establishment and wraps them all up in one tidy ball for kicking.  It's also a notable departure for a man known almost entirely for his inability to look past the present moment. Trump, officially, is no longer content with being the mere arbiter of the present, requiring compliance and agreement from everybody in the room. By attacking journalists, appointing a commission to lock down history in a way that pleases him and giving grant money for a “pro-America” curriculum, Trump intends to assert a new ownership interest in the past. “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past,” George Orwell wrote in Nineteen Eighty-Four. With his National Archives Museum diatribe, Trump has staked his personal claim.  ******  The dumbest thing William Faulkner ever wrote was, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” Like, that makes no sense. Send your favorite “past” lines to [email protected]. My email alerts considered a career in education. My Twitter feed was an Education major.

Aside from apportioning House seats, the Census provides the statistical basis for many governmental funding decisions for the next decade. Each year, roughly $1.5 trillion in federal funds get redistributed according to census data.  With undercounted populations disproportionately made up of Black Americans, Latinos, lower-income households and immigrants, an undercount would mean not only less political representation for those groups, but also fewer resources going to those communities. “It is a political issue, but it’s also just an issue of access to the resources of our country,” said Frey.  What could go wrong? How is this year’s census shaping up differently than past counts? And what are the short- and long-term effects of everything we’re about to encounter? To sort through it all, POLITICO spoke with Frey on Thursday. A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity.  Stanton: You've studied the census. You’re a demographer. Walk us through how a census normally works, and how the pandemic has changed the way the census is working this year.  Frey: Normally, the census is the culmination of 10 years of hard work by people at the Census Bureau and their partners around the country. It’s a huge civic-engagement exercise that people take a lot of pride in. Census Day — April 1st every 10 years, when the census begins to be administered — is a time of celebration and public events and civic leaders getting everybody to fill out their census forms. The results come in, and at the end of December, they are released to the states and used to reapportion House seats and draw congressional and state legislative districts, which is the official reason for the census.  Then, over the following year, more detailed data come out for smaller geographic areas, different populations and subgroups — like where people are living or where populations are growing — and get used by researchers for the next decade. It’s used for all kinds of planning. I’m a demographer, so I’m biased, but I think it’s probably one of the most important government functions there is. There’s usually not a lot of politics around it; it’s usually a feel-good kind of operation. That’s the kind of census that we were hoping to have.  Stanton: I sense there’s a “but” coming.  Frey: Yes. This year, the Census Bureau was hit with a huge impediment: the pandemic. On April 1, Census Day, most people were worried about the pandemic. You saw very little about it in media, because coronavirus cases were popping up, and places were closing down and people were worried about how they were going to get to work or if they were going to have work. The census was not on people’s minds. More importantly, from the operational standpoint, the Census couldn’t conduct the kinds of operations they normally would.  The pandemic really threw a monkey wrench into the whole process. Around the middle of April, the Census Bureau decided that it had to postpone a lot of its follow-up activities. Normally, they do something called NRFU — “non-response follow-ups.” That’s when they follow up with people who did not fill out their census forms. Normally, that would take place between the middle of May and the end of July, which allows the bureau to take the time between the end July and the end of December — when they have to report the results of the census to the president — to deal with all sorts of logistical issues and make sure there weren’t double counts. This is the biggest survey in the world, and they only get one chance every 10 years to get it right.  “This is the biggest survey in the world, and they only get one chance every 10 years to get it right.”  Under normal circumstances, they would have begun that cleanup at the end of July. But in April, they decided that they had to push back everything because of the pandemic: Rather than have the NRFU go from mid-May to the end of July, they shifted it to go from mid-August until the end of October. As a result, they thought they would not be able to report the results to the president by the end of December and requested that Congress give them a four-month lag so that they would have until the end of April.  But a bigger issue came at the end of July, when President Trump came out with a memorandum that said he wanted to figure out how many undocumented immigrants were included in the census counts of each state in order to exclude them for the purposes of congressional reapportionment. Now, if you've been following this issue, you know that he’s been trying to do something like this for a long time. Initially, he wanted to put a question on the 2020 Census, something like: “Are you a citizen or are you not a citizen of the United States?” It got struck down by the Supreme Court and he wasn’t able to do that. This is a way around that to try to accomplish the same goal. It’s probably not legal, and there are many lawsuits about it, but it takes a while for things to go through the courts. So that’s one part of the bombshell.  Then, the other shoe dropped on Aug. 3, when the president said that all of this planning that the Census Bureau did to postpone the delivery of results so that they could ensure the numbers were good and they could follow up with nonresponses — he wants to rush that, and they still need to get those results in to him by the end of December. And now, the Census Bureau has to stop following up with nonresponsive people at the end of September, a month early, which will give them three months to fix everything, instead of the normal five or six. Of course, they cannot do the same kind of diligent job in just three months.

People who previously worked at the Census Bureau — including four prior Census directors under both Democratic and Republican administrations — have come out and said it’s not a good idea. You’re going to wind up with results that severely undercount large parts of the population — the “hard to count” populations, including people of color, immigrants, poor people, very young people, renters and a whole list of people who are going to be undercounted and underrepresented in terms of political clout as well as services and government funds, which use the census as a benchmark for the next 10 years. Something like $1.5 trillion of federal funds annually get redistributed on the basis of these census counts. It’s a real problem.  It puts the Census Bureau in a horrible situation. For those of us who analyze data and want to do research—and even more importantly, for people who are planning policy or allocating federal funds—this puts everybody in in a huge predicament. It puts the whole country in a bad situation.\"}\n",

Four years later, DeSantis asked Stuper to write him a letter of recommendation for Harvard Law. “He showed me the last two years of his transcript,” the coach said, “and there wasn’t a B on it anywhere, and I’m, like, ‘Jesus, this is like a Stepford freaking transcript.’”  Lest he be accused of doing nothing but extolling DeSantis, Stuper talked, too, about what happened right after DeSantis kick-started his collegiate career with that well-struck base hit. “‘D,’ I said, if you get on, we’re going to hit and run,’” the coach recalled. “‘I’m not going to give any signs or anything. We’re just going to hit and run on the first pitch.’ ‘OK, OK, OK.’” And? “So, um, it didn’t work, because before the guy even threw a pitch to the plate, he picked D off.” Stuper called it “a cardinal sin” to “get picked off on a hit and run.” He added, “He may have forgotten that, but I haven’t.”  “Absolutely,” DeSantis said in his office, more than 22 years later, when asked whether he remembered.  The governor said it was the umpire’s fault.  “See, what happens,” he said, “is when you have a two-man umpiring crew, the base umpire is behind the pitcher, so what a pitcher would do is a balk move. They would lift the left heel, like they were going to the plate, but then they would turn around. And so Stuper was, like, ‘You can never get picked off on that.’ I was, like, ‘Coach, he balked.’”  DeSantis keeps a minuscule inner circle. It often can consist of just his wife and his chief of staff. Sometimes, some say, it’s not even that. “The political circle is linear,” said Scott Parkinson, a former chief of staff, “and it is him and Casey.” And that was true right from the start.  Early in 2012, Travis Cummings was readying to run in Northeast Florida for a spot in the state House, and he was having lunch with Kent Stermon—who now is near the top of the short list of friends of DeSantis but back then hadn’t met him. Cummings told Stermon about DeSantis, calling him “interesting” and “just kind of this upstart guy,” Stermon recalled. A couple days later there was a knock at his door. It wasn’t Ron DeSantis. It was Casey DeSantis, a midday host on the highest-rated network affiliate in Jacksonville, whom he married in 2009. She was “stumping for him,” Stermon said.  “I said, ‘Hey, I’m going to this charity event later on tonight. There’ll be a ton of money in the room. Bring your husband. I’ll introduce him to people.’ She’s, like, ‘We’ll be there.’ And it’s like a hundred degrees outside—it’s like 3 o’clock—and they gotta be there at like 6 o’clock. I told my wife, ‘There’s no way they show up’—6:15, there they walk up.”  That year, in his first campaign for elected office, DeSantis was, at 33 years old, in the right place at the right time and not by accident. He had identified an open seat in Congress in Florida’s newly drawn 6th District, stretching from Jacksonville to Orlando but not actually including any part of either city, “a tweener district,” in the words of a Democratic strategist, somewhat under the radar and eminently winnable for a Republican.  DeSantis just had to get through a jumbled primary. To do that, he ran not so much against the six other GOP candidates but against the sitting president. Against the government. Against Washington. The double Ivy Leaguer ran as an outsider, as a Tea Party hard-liner, as a “constitutional conservative” in the mold of Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. He wanted to roll back environmental regulations and eliminate the Department of Energy and repeal the Affordable Care Act. He wanted stronger border security, opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He opposed all gun reform. He said food stamps should have on them a picture of Barack Obama and that the president wanted to create “a dependency culture.” He said a second term of Obama would mean the “death knell” of “limited government.” His pitch attracted the attention and the endorsements of national conservative groups like FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth and the Conservative Victory Fund; of Lee, the Utah senator; of controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio; of John Bolton—and of the most prominent peddler of the racist conspiracy theory that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S.'}\n",

But when World War I came, he created our first and only ministry of propaganda, the Committee on Public Information, a body that did the opposite of provide public information.  What had been a trickle of press releases under Roosevelt turned into a gusher of tendentious handouts from the CPI offices near the White House, as well as pamphlets, books, syndicated articles, posters, advertisements, cartoons and films. University professors were enlisted. Front organizations reached labor and immigrants. The Boy Scouts and traveling salesmen, among many others, were turned into conveyer belts for government information. Like Trump’s HHS feel-good advertising campaign, the CPI was created by a president without congressional approval.  Wild-eyed muckraker George Creel was the chief of the CPI. He was so good at what he did that what we call “spin” today was called “Creeling” during the war.  Even before Wilson’s CPI came into being, Congress was not happy to have the president and executive agencies using public relations techniques to persuade the public. “This press-bureau business is a sort of political campaigning,” one legislator complained in 1913. Congress hounded Roosevelt to force his secretary of the Panama Canal Committee, a former journalist, to stop his public relations activities. It passed laws forbidding executive agencies to hire “publicity experts” or to use advertisements, telegrams and other means of mass communications to stoke public pressure on legislators to vote for or against any particular pending legislation. Legislators also added prohibitions to annual spending bills to prevent the use of funds for “propaganda and publicity purposes not authorized by Congress.”  President Woodrow Wilson (left) and CPI chief George Creel (right). | AP Photo, Library of Congress  To little avail. Those laws are still in effect, but executive agencies have routinely evaded them. Officials get around the restriction on publicity agents by giving public relations staff such titles as “health communications specialist” or they outsource the spinmeister work to private communications firms. During an effort to cut back on PR in the administration of Harry Truman, the Air Force even classified some public affairs officers as chaplains.  Federal agencies answering to the president routinely pressure Congress to pass presidential priorities — to stay within the law, they need only avoid mentioning a specific bill name or number. This happened often during the Obama administration; the Department of Labor, NASA and HHS issued communications pushing for Congress to increase the minimum wage, increase NASA funding, and enact Obamacare. On rare occasion, the Government Accountability Office will flag an agency for spending funds for illicit propaganda.  But there is no real penalty. The Department of Justice may simply disagree that there has been any wrongdoing, or the propagandizing agency may ignore GAO’s demand to repay the misspent money. No executive branch official has ever been charged with breaking these laws. And the majority in Congress tend to turn a blind eye when it is their president who does the propagandizing.  All of which explains why every administration does it. Obama had a $700 million PR blitz for his signature health care law. The George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations both produced fake video news pieces to promote their new Medicare program benefits. And so forth.  Representative democracy depends on government communicating honestly with the public. The public can’t hold elected leaders accountable if citizens don’t know what they are doing. Citizens also have a right to know how government is spending their money, and whether it is producing bang for the buck. Accurate government information also can serve public good purposes: It is helpful to know, for example, what the unemployment rate is, whether a hurricane is approaching, and how much children are learning in school.  But self-governance is corrupted when an administration uses taxpayers’ dollars to manipulate their beliefs about its performance or reality generally. This betrays a premise of our political system: that government exists to serve the public. The current administration’s playing down of the coronavirus peril and its confusing and self-contradictory advice to the public (e.g., Trump vs. his FDA on hydroxychloroquine) are a salient and existential example.  Which is why this nation desperately needs major reform of the ways that the executive branch communicates with the public. Here are three reforms that can start to right the flow of information from government to the public.  First, Americans deserve an audit of how much the government is spending on communications with the public, and an assessment of where the dollars are going. Data from USASpending.gov indicate executive agencies will spend nearly $1.4 billion on advertising contracts with private firms. But this grossly understates actual expenditures, as it excludes the government’s in-house costs, such as the compensation earned by the legions of communications staff across the executive branch, or the costs for operating the government’s innumerable blogs and YouTube channels. The GAO has audited some individual agencies in the past, but Congress could direct it to assess all 170 federal agencies. In the course of doing that, the GAO could usefully propose a definition of “public communication” that all agencies would have to use in accounting for their spending. None presently exists.  It would be wise to establish uniform and publicly available standards that make clear what is expected of government agencies in their communications with the public.  Second, Congress should appoint a bipartisan, blue ribbon commission to consider ways to update the antiquated laws on government communications with the public. For instance, federal spending laws forbid agencies from using funds for unauthorized “publicity” or “propaganda” but fail to define these terms or even hint at differences between them and acceptable government communications. One standard, for instance, might require that communications should be balanced and written in a tone that does not extol the agency or its activities.  The law against employing publicity experts, which was enacted in response to Roosevelt’s self-promotion, is effectively useless now. And the statute forbidding agency communications with the public is anachronistic; for one thing, it forbids the use of telegrams, but not the internet. Nor do any of these laws provide for any sort of real punishment for violations. Not least, the panel should consider policies to stop agencies from spending funds to turn their spokespeople into media darlings.  This panel also could develop governmentwide guidelines for agency public communications practices, which Congress could enact into law. Right now, agencies—with some direction from the Office of Management and Budget—are free to develop their own communications policies. This hodgepodge of policies makes little sense, seeing as communications boondoggles and scandals are perennial. It would be wise to establish uniform and publicly available standards that make clear what is expected of government agencies in their communications with the public.  Congress took a run at writing guidelines in 2001, when it passed the Information Quality Act. Rather than revise the few existing policies, it instead directed agencies to adopt policies “ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated.” Regrettably, Congress simply trusted agencies to obey those vague guidelines and followed up very little to ensure compliance. This time around Congress would be wise to mandate information quality standards and require public reporting of agencies efforts to enact them.  Third, the White House news conference needs an overhaul. Done right, the process of getting ready for a daily briefing contributes to government accountability. The press secretary reaches out to executive departments to assess the issues of the day and identify the corresponding administration policy. After looking at the daily press briefing book, Clinton was known to call a Cabinet secretary to say a better policy was needed.'}\n",

Virginia ruling. You could, say, have an Indian mom and a Jamaican dad, and you’d still be Black. You could have a Filipino dad and a Black mom so light-skinned she made you do a double-take, and you’d still be Black. Your mom could be a white lady from the Netherlands and your dad could be a Black man from D.C., and you’d still be Black. You could have two deep dark chocolate parents and sound like a Valley Girl, and of course, you'd still be Black.  Like Harris, I’m a middle-class Generation Joneser, a Black preppie who also swore allegiance to his Purple Majesty. Some of us, like Harris—and like Prince—were bused to all-white schools from majority-Black neighborhoods. Others, like me, grew up in the ’burbs and boroughs next door to white kids, attending prep schools or Catholic academies or the local public schools, part of a hugely optimistic, messy national experiment. (Never mind that folks had been crossing the color line for years, often by force, creating a rainbow of phenotypes among African Americans.)  This didn’t always make for some rosy kumbaya moment. We grew up with the specter of nuclear war hanging over our heads, when it really felt like it could all end with the push of a button, as Prince warned us in 1999. And a lot of times, especially once we got to high school and dating made everything a lot more complicated, we were too Black for the white kids—and way too white for the Black kids.  Code-switching became embedded in our DNA. Barack Obama, another integration baby, was mocked for his fluid code-switching. But for us, that’s not performance. It’s just a survival tool.  That cultural adeptness makes for a canny politician. It’s an adeptness that has held Harris in good stead on the campaign trail, whether she’s jamming to a drumline, making dosas with Mindy Kaling or dragging Joe Biden for his record on school desegregation. And it’s an adeptness that will be on display as she faces off against Mike Pence in the first and only 2020 vice presidential debate.  Compromise and consensus are a key personality trait of Generation Jonesers, particularly among Jonesers of color, said Jonathan Pontell, a social generation expert, who coined the phrase. But that compromising nature, in this era of political extremes, can seem out of step, something for which both Harris and Obama have faced criticism.  “It’s a great skill to have as a politician, to be able to compromise, bring people together,” said Pontell, who’s working on a book about Generation Jones. “But I don’t know how realistic idealism is right now. We as a country are very tribal — and very angry.”  Jonesers, he said, were weaned on idealism as kids in the ’70s, only to be confronted as young adults with the money-hungry cynicism of the ’80s. We were the guinea pigs living through the real changes effected by the turmoil of the ’60s, turmoil we were too young to understand. As integration babies, Black Jonesers were raised with high expectations, expected to excel, to bust ceilings.  But racism is real, and often, when we were accepted into Harvard or Yale or Dartmouth or got that plum job, our peers, the kids we hung out with on the playground, accused us of being unworthy beneficiaries of affirmative action. Racism, we learned, has a particular sting when it’s being wielded by the one you thought was your ride or die. It’s why some of us, like Harris, embraced HBCU life, seeking belonging. Acceptance.  Straddling the racial divide can be a painful and lonely place. A number of my friends, bougie Black kids who grew up with the best, and with expectations to be the best, didn’t make it out of their 30s alive—felled by drugs, or by suicide, or by sheer bad luck.  Prince knew all this, tapping into the angst of a subgeneration. He always looked askance at the poor hand we’d been dealt, but he hid from the world, choosing to shroud himself in mystery.  Toward the end of his life, though, he picked out his ’fro and stepped into the light, becoming increasingly vocal about his politics, speaking out for Black Lives Matter. In the wake of the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of Baltimore police, he held a benefit concert he dubbed, “Rally 4 Peace.”  When he died, my husband and I held a vigil at our house, playing Prince nonstop, wiping away tears. I’ve read that Kamala and her husband did the same.\"}\n",

Known as the “Anderson-Burdick” balancing test (named for two Supreme Court cases involving access to the ballot), it requires courts, first, to determine whether an election law imposes a “severe burden” on an individual voter’s rights. If a court decides that a burden is “severe,” then it must apply what’s known as “strict scrutiny” to the law. This means that the government has to have a very strong reason justifying the measure, or it gets struck down. A ban on voting based on race, for example, would trigger—and fail—this test. (Although Ginsburg worked to secure the highest possible test for gender, the Supreme Court settled on a lower, “intermediate scrutiny” standard for discrimination based on sex.) If the court decides that the restriction is not severe, a lower level of scrutiny applies, meaning the government doesn’t need to work so hard to justify it. As important as these standards are, unfortunately the Supreme Court hasn’t defined these terms with much clarity, affording judges a high level of subjectivity when they analyze whether a voting restriction should stand.  Barrett knows this test well, because she applied it in a 2019 opinion she authored for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Acevedo v. Cook County Officers Electoral Board involved a Democratic primary ballot for Cook County sheriff in Illinois. County law required the candidate to obtain signatures equal 0.5 percent of the county’s qualified voters in order to get on the ballot. That meant the plaintiff, Edward Acevedo, had to collect 8,236 valid signatures. He failed, and sued, claiming the law violated his First and 14th Amendment rights to freedom of association and equal protection. Acevedo pointed to the lower statewide requirement of only 5,000 signatures, arguing that the county’s higher threshold was unconstitutional.  In Acevedo, Barrett decided that the need “for orderly and fair elections” outweighed the relatively nonsevere First and 14th Amendment interests of the candidate. The signature requirement, she ruled, was “not severe.” Prior cases made it “hard for Acevedo to show that the 0.5 percent requirement is anything but slight, which is perhaps why he doesn’t even try.” She concluded, “[i]t goes almost without saying that this slight burden is justified by Illinois’s relevant and legitimate state interests.” She made no mention of his First Amendment argument that ballot access burdened his free association rights.  Certainly, a case involving a county sheriff has nowhere near the national impact of a case involving a presidential election as hotly contested as the one now underway. Nevertheless, the Anderson-Burdick test that would come into play in both should make a textualist such as Barrett squeamish.  It gives lifetime, unelected judges massive discretion to control state electoral processes with virtually no guiding principles from the Constitution itself. But that’s not Barrett’s fault. The test is one of many that are “read into” the Constitution by the Supreme Court—not because the justices are bad judges, but because the Constitution is hopelessly ambiguous. If a case involving the 2020 election reaches the Supreme Court over the constitutionality of state law requirements like signature-matching on mail-in ballots, notary public mandates for signing ballots, closed polling sites or limits on drop-off boxes, the Supreme Court will almost certainly apply this highly subjective test.  For Republican-led challenges to laws that make voting easier, the court will likely face the false argument that voter fraud is a serious problem in the United States. Studies show that voter fraud is exceedingly scarce, and there is no evidence to support Trump’s allegation that millions of undocumented immigrants in 2016 voted for his opponent. Will a conservative-leaning court apply low-level scrutiny and simply credit—without evidence—Republicans’ cynical arguments about staving off hypothetical voter fraud through identification requirements that disproportionately affect low-income Americans and people of color? Or will it nod in favor of voter access, in deference to the idea that the implied right to vote is the fulcrum of all other rights we hold dear?  After Nov. 3, we can also anticipate Republican-led challenges to state laws that allow election officials to count ballots after Election Day. Indeed, many states mandate that counting begin only after the last ballot is cast. For an election with an anticipated avalanche of mail-in ballots, these laws mean that poll workers will have to match signatures (with no expertise and little training), open envelopes, unfold ballots, stack them, feed them into machines and resolve any disparities before the votes are fully tallied. In a minority of states, voters are given an opportunity to correct errors. If a case were to reach the Supreme Court challenging post-Nov. 3 ballot-counting, the court would again be faced with the squishy balancing test that allows judges to apply their own discretion in deciding if a burden is severe and unjustified. And again, elusive voter fraud will be the countervailing argument.  Fast forward to 2021, and imagine a Biden administration with a Democratic House and Senate.  After Democrats won the House in 2018, the first piece of legislation passed was H.R. 1, which is widely praised by election law experts as a much-needed and reasonable set of reforms to America’s electoral system. Dubbed the For the People Act of 2019, the bill would make sweeping reforms to political gerrymandering (which the Supreme Court punted back to legislatures by rejecting a challenge in Rucho v. Common Cause last year), voting rights (which the Supreme Court hampered when it struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013), money in campaigns (which the Supreme Court ushered in en masse by lodging First Amendment rights in corporate speech in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission), and ethics rules for government officials (which is badly needed after Trump’s serial firing of inspectors general, a post-Watergate legislative reform designed to foster neutral oversight of those in power). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the bill in his chamber, but a new Democratic majority in the Senate would likely pass it, inviting inevitable conservative legal challenges.  Conservative jurisprudence has traditionally emphasized states’ rights and deference to lawmaking performed by lawmakers who represent the electorate—and not by judges. Challenges to state voting laws passed to facilitate access during a pandemic inescapably collide with the conservative touchstone of federalism. By the same token, challenges to acts of Congress confront the other conservative ideal, which aims to keep judges out of the business of legislating.  For all her professed devotion to conservative approaches to constitutional and statutory analysis, it is not entirely clear that Barrett wouldn’t readily defer to a state’s generic interest in “fair and orderly elections” or the voters’ access to the ballot if Trump’s election were hanging in the balance. Perhaps even more than abortion, voting rights is the key issue that Senators must probe deeply with Barrett in her confirmation hearing. Literally nothing is more important to the interests of their constituents.'}\n",

According to data maintained by Syracuse University that spans more than 30 years, the Justice Department’s number of white-collar prosecutions has repeatedly hit all-time lows during Trump’s tenure. To be sure, these problems did not all start under Trump’s watch—as law professor Jennifer Taub explains in her new book Big Dirty Money—but they have gotten markedly worse.  The divergent trends—increasing financial crime, decreasing enforcement—should already have been a national scandal. The sheer scale of the many other forms of corruption and ineptitude throughout this administration, however, seem to have prevented it from breaking through, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic. Now is an opportune time for the Biden campaign to make the case to the public for a concerted crackdown on financial crime—to explain that the federal government desperately needs a prompt, wholesale and aggressive effort to improve the effectiveness of its law enforcement apparatus in this area, if there is any hope for change.  There are many reasons for the current state of affairs, even beyond Trump’s personal interests. One of them is that neither Attorney General William Barr nor former Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemed to have had much interest in pursuing financial crime. Barr has been more interested in expanding executive power and promoting Trump’s political and personal priorities. Sessions used the job to advance his interest in making life as difficult as possible for undocumented immigrants. There has also been a series of internal policy changes that have led to greater leniency in corporate criminal investigations—including the reversal of a policy created by former Obama Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates that required prosecutors to pursue individuals who committed criminal misconduct at corporations instead of merely entering into big-dollar settlements with the companies and moving on.  Meanwhile, there has been a noticeable deficit of high-level prosecutorial talent in the department, owing at least in part to the fact (widely known in legal circles) that many prominent conservative lawyers did not want to work in the Trump Justice Department—due to distaste for the man and his policies, concerns over the long-term financial impact of going back to the private sector after working for the most divisive president in decades, or both. A surprising number of senior Justice Department officials overseeing wide swathes of the country’s criminal law enforcement work have never even been prosecutors. As a result, the Trump-era political appointees and career officials who manage the department’s work in this area have overseen a surprisingly long list of high-profile losses and setbacks in the last few years.  Covid-19 appears to have made matters worse. There has been a wave of consumer financial fraud that has grown out of the pandemic that the Justice Department has done virtually nothing to address and that has resulted in more than 200,000 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, totaling more than $150 million in losses. But because financial fraud is significantly underreported (many people are ashamed to admit that they have been victimized), the real numbers are likely at least several multiples of these figures. The department has also done little to pursue an international fraud on state unemployment agencies using stolen personal information from Americans, which has cost states at least hundreds of millions of dollars.  The issue has gotten virtually no attention during the general election campaign, but it was one of the many policy areas that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren raised during the Democratic presidential primaries. Among other things, she campaigned on a law that she had proposed that would have allowed the government to criminally prosecute corporate executives who had negligently overseen companies where criminal conduct had occurred. That particular proposal had its detractors, but it represented much-needed fresh thinking in the area and started a discussion about the limits of white-collar criminal enforcement that had been dormant for too long.  After Warren and others dropped out of the race, however, that issue fell by the wayside. Biden has instead pursued a campaign strategy structured around pledges to reunite the country, level the economic playing field and contain the pandemic. For better or worse politically, Biden’s campaign has let events dictate its priorities rather than try to direct the country’s focus. In so doing, Biden’s criminal justice plan has been focused on addressing the pervasive racial inequities in the system—which have rightly come under scrutiny again in recent months as a result of police violence and widespread protests—as well as other key progressive priorities, like reducing mass incarceration. But one effect of this gap in Biden’s public platform is that it has left his campaign at least partially flat-footed dealing with the stories on Trump’s taxes in the New York Times. If Biden’s campaign had had a concrete and comprehensive proposal to address white-collar crime and financial crime, this could have been a major opportunity for it to tie the news to specific policy ideas. It didn’t.  Voters interested in this topic actually have some reason to be skeptical of the attention that this problem might receive in a Biden presidency, since the Justice Department during Barack Obama’s presidency drew a significant amount of criticism over its failure to pursue fraudsters and corporate misconduct after the last financial crisis. Which is why taking a more outspoken stand makes all the more sense for Joe Biden. There is even good reason to believe—as a strictly political matter—that doing so could draw the support of people from both the tough-on-crime right and the political left. It is an issue not nearly as ideologically polarizing as the race and policing questions that have dominated the campaign.  What should Biden do? He could start by proposing to initiate a uniform federal effort to collect data on the national prevalence of financial crime, which, unlike for other crimes, does not yet exist. Ensuring the right people are in positions of power in the Justice Department would obviously be important too, but the administration under Biden could also issue a directive to local U.S. Attorneys’ offices throughout the country to make this a key priority for enforcement, much like the Trump administration did with immigration.  The Biden campaign could pledge that, if elected, his Justice Department would at least revisit—and strongly consider reversing—the changes to department policy under the Trump administration that have made the enforcement of financial criminal laws more lax, like giving leniency to corporations that self-report the misconduct of their employees. Biden could take a law-and-order approach, promising that his administration would seek a dramatic increase in funding for law enforcement agencies so that they can increase their capabilities, including by hiring more financial analysts, economists and prosecutors. He could promise to make a concerted effort to improve coordination between regulatory agencies and the Justice Department—particularly consumer protection agencies like the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—so that serious cases that lead to civil penalties receive appropriate attention as potential criminal matters too. For a candidate dogged by questions of how he would be able to pay for his proposed climate and health care programs, Biden could pledge to dramatically ramp up the IRS’ audit and enforcement capabilities, so that the government actually brings in more of the money it’s owed. And he could argue that the prosecution of criminal tax fraud would be a top priority.  As for Trump, in a properly functioning Justice Department, his tax avoidance, global financial entanglements, and unusual business and campaign transactions already would have attracted the attention of prosecutors. In fairness to the president, it is too soon to conclude that he has committed any crimes. That said, there would be more than enough reason for a very fulsome investigation if this were anyone but the president. But even setting Trump aside, one thing is clear: This country has been in the midst of an epidemic of financial crime that has been getting worse by the day. Now is the time for the Biden campaign to make this the prominent issue for voters that it can—and should—be.'}\n",

In a lecture at NYU Law School just a few months before her nomination to the Supreme Court, she questioned the rationale and timing of Roe v. Wade, blaming the court’s overbroad decision for the continued political controversy over abortion. Given that she’s become a legal giant and progressive hero, it seems amazing that anyone once doubted Ginsburg’s pro-choice commitments.  The Supreme Court will now be as big an issue in the 2020 election as it was in 2016. It would be better if our law and politics didn’t turn on the physical health of judges, but, alas, that’s not the world we’re in.  ‘She never let abstract ideas distract her from reality’  Gillian Metzger is a professor and co-director of the Center for Constitutional Governance at Columbia Law School.  Justice Ginsburg had an extraordinary mind. But unlike some great minds, she never let abstract ideas distract her from reality. Her deep and abiding commitment to justice and equality drove her analytic rigor, not the other way round. All of the great opinions she penned — Virginia Military Institute, her dissents in Ledbetter and Shelby County, even her dissent this last term in Little Sisters — were so powerful because she showed how our greatest constitutional principles and legal traditions must speak to and reflect the reality we all live. This focus on law in reality may have come from her years as a women’s rights advocate, but also was what led her to become an advocate in the first place. It is why she became so uniquely notorious, and her death is a huge loss.  She understood the potential in all people  John Culhane is a professor of law and co-director of the Family Health Law & Policy Institute at Widener University Delaware Law School.  Through her long life, a life marked by surpassing courage and blinding luminescence, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg propelled this nation forward in so many ways. In the areas of voting rights, affirmative action and the march toward LGBT+ equality, her legacy will endure. But she will be most forcefully invoked for the tectonic shift she wrought for gender equality. Both women and men have benefited from the simple elegance of her insistence that people be judged by who they are and what they do — not by their assignment to frozen, long-unexamined roles. Among her numberless contributions to that project, perhaps her opinion for the Supreme Court in the Virginia Military Institute case, where the court ruled against the school’s exclusion of women, best encapsulates her philosophy. No law or policy, she wrote, can deny “to women, simply because they are women, equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in, and contribute to society, based upon what they can do.” Substitute “people” for “women” in that quotation to fully appreciate what Justice Ginsburg understood about the potential in all of us.  ‘The founding mother — or simply founder — of our nation’s sex equality jurisprudence’  Kenji Yoshino is a professor of constitutional law at NYU School of Law.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg transformed sex equality law — as a professor, as an advocate, as a judge and then finally as a justice on the United States Supreme Court. We see that most clearly in her canonical majority opinion in the 1996 case of United States v. Virginia, which held that the Virginia Military Institute could not deny women admission. She wrote: “[G]eneralizations about ‘the way women are,’ estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunities to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description.” Like its author, this sentence was quietly radical. Its logic means that if any woman can meet a state’s standard for an opportunity, no woman can be denied access to it. That view has resonated across the decades to gradually reduce sex stereotypes about women — and men. It helped lay the foundation for cases ranging from the court’s 2015 decision recognizing same-sex marriage to its decisions just last term barring employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  It would be too faint praise to observe that Justice Ginsburg’s own “talent and capacity” placed her far, far “outside the average description.” More than any other justice, she has embedded the principle that biology is not destiny into our fundamental law. As such, she can rightly be deemed the founding mother — or simply founder — of our nation’s sex equality jurisprudence. So it seems apt to bid her farewell bid her farewell with Chief Justice John Marshall’s words — penned just over two centuries ago — to the original Founding Fathers: “No tribute can be paid to [her] which exceeds [her] merit.”  ‘She was an exemplar of purpose and poise’  Josh Blackman is a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and the president of the Harlan Institute.  On September 17, we marked the 233rd anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. On September 18, we mourned the passing of a constitutional giant. Throughout her remarkable career, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg left an indelible mark on how our Constitution is understood, and she was an exemplar of purpose and poise. As an attorney, she litigated the landmark gender equality cases. Her strategy was simple but momentous: Make the all-male Supreme Court understand why the government should not discriminate against people because of their sex. As a Supreme Court justice, she eloquently and persuasively articulated her constitutional vision for nearly three decades. As a colleague, she modeled civility, even with her jurisprudential foes. It is well known that she became dear friends with Justice Antonin Scalia. And as a pop icon, she inspired a generation of young women to aspire for greatness. May her memory be a blessing. The only consolation for this sad moment is that Justice Ginsburg can now be reunited with her beloved husband, Martin. And I hope she can soon enjoy a performance of The Marriage of Figaro at the big opera house in the sky — with her old pal Justice Scalia humming along.  She reminded us that realizing America’s ideals is a work in progress  Robert L. Tsai is a professor of law at American University and author of Practical Equality .  The promise of equality was her life’s work. From her pioneering litigation strategies as the head of the Women’s Rights Project at the ACLU to her quietly determined efforts to enforce the Constitution’s 14th Amendment as a justice on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had the audacity to improve upon Thomas Jefferson’s famous words: “All men are created equal.” She understood that the phrase comprised a living commitment rather than a description of reality.

What now? Presented by Facebook  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will remain at home after being diagnosed with Covid-19. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images  DRIVING THE DAY  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP -- who is tested for the coronavirus daily and has downplayed its risks, mocked the use of masks, proudly held large political rallies and suggested the nation should get back to its pre-virus business -- has tested positive for the deadly disease 32 DAYS before Election Day, pushing the nation’s political and governing apparatus into a historic state of flux.  TRUMP, 74, tweeted at 12:54 a.m.: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” This comes after senior White House aide HOPE HICKS tested positive.  THE PRESIDENT and first lady will “remain at home within the White House during their convalescence,” White House physician SEAN CONLEY said in a memo released by the White House at 1:05 a.m. The doc’s memo  IT’S EXTRAORDINARILY EARLY, we don’t know much at the moment, and we all need to be vigilant about everything we say and suppose. But here are some early points to frame your thinking:  1) EVERY MOVE MADE, every word uttered and tweet published by the White House will be under a microscope as the world tries to understand the health of the most powerful man in the world. We will be looking this morning for test results and assurance from VP MIKE PENCE and Speaker NANCY PELOSI.  2) THE WHITE HOUSE does not have the public’s trust, and at a time like this, that’s important.  3) THE PRESIDENT will be quarantined for some time, so the 2020 CAMPAIGN as we knew it will be effectively paused in its final stretch. How can they allow TRUMP in a room with the 77-year-old JOE BIDEN for another debate at this point? How can TRUMP hold another in-person rally? It seems extremely unlikely.  THE ENTIRETY of the president’s political message was that he handled the coronavirus pandemic well, the end was in sight, and people should think back to before the onset of the virus when they consider their vote. TRUMP’S diagnosis will make that quite tricky. NYT’s Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Matt Stevens on the political implications  -- NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and PETER BAKER say this: “If [Trump] becomes sick, it could raise questions about whether he should remain on the ballot at all.”  4) ONE WOULD IMAGINE the administration and the Congress will do everything they can to preserve the health of the rest of the chain of command. That means that PENCE, PELOSI and Sen. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-Iowa) will likely have to take extra precautions. PELOSI is 80 and GRASSLEY is 87. They are No. 2 and No. 3 in the line of succession, after PENCE.  5) BIDEN will certainly be tested. Political and financial markets will be incredibly interested in his results.  6) THE PRESIDENT’S DIAGNOSIS should, theoretically, force Congress to rethink its testing regime. Reminder: Members of Congress are forced to travel to D.C. to vote, but they are not tested. THE HOUSE is going to leave after today. THE SENATE will be in next week -- as of now. There will be an effort to show government can still operate with the commander in chief sidelined.  TRUMP’S ILLNESS could have long-term political and practical implications, but, as of now, it appears as if the government will continue to operate as normal in the short term. Federal agencies have been operating in a pandemic mode for months.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS swarming Capitol Hill. White House chief of staff MARK MEADOWS has been in contact with SCOTUS nominee AMY CONEY BARRETT, Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL and a host of other key GOP senators. Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN, who typically wears a mask, was at an in-person meeting with PELOSI on Wednesday.

A BIT OF THE BACK STORY … NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and ANNIE KARNI: “It is not yet clear when and how Mr. Trump contracted the virus. The president and the first lady said they had both tested positive hours after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, also tested positive. Ms. Hicks received the diagnosis after she began experiencing symptoms on Wednesday while attending the president’s rally in Minnesota. Mr. Trump kept his appearance there to about 45 minutes, roughly half the length of one of his typical rally speeches.  “Early Friday morning, it was still unclear how many other aides who had come into close contact with Mr. Trump had tested positive, but the White House said its medical unit was conducting contact tracing. Top advisers to the president described themselves as in a state of shock and said they expected a number of additional cases among people in Mr. Trump’s orbit. White House officials had hoped to keep the news about Ms. Hicks from becoming public, to no avail. …  “On Tuesday Mr. Trump was accompanied by all of his adult children and senior members of his White House and campaign staff on Air Force One en route to Cleveland for the first presidential debate. None of them wore masks as they were seen boarding and deplaning. Bill Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, was seen on board without a mask and then was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms. Hicks.”  WAPO’S JOSH DAWSEY and COLBY ITKOWITZ: “After White House officials learned of Hicks’s symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event.”  CREDIT WHERE DUE -- The news of Hicks’ positive diagnosis was first reported by Bloomberg’s JENNIFER JACOBS, not disclosed by the White House.  MARKETWATCH … WSJ: “U.S. Stock Futures Drop After Trump Tests Positive for Covid-19,” by Chong Koh Ping  TRUMP’S, UH, UPDATED FRIDAY SCHEDULE -- The president will host a phone call on Covid-19 support for vulnerable seniors at 12:15 p.m. in the White House.  HOURS BEFORE THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE SHIFTED ON ITS AXIS -- “Biden flip-flops on door-knocking with just 33 days left,” by Alex Thompson and Holly Otterbein  Good Friday morning.  FOR THE RECORD -- 48 HOURS. That’s how long it took for TRUMP to condemn white supremacists after coming under fire for comments during the presidential debate. Last night on SEAN HANNITY’S Fox New show: “I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that,” Trump said in a phone interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “But [Biden] should condemn also Antifa. Antifa is a horrible group of people.” More from Matthew Choi  -- AP: “Trump debate comment pushing Black Americans, others to vote,” by Kat Stafford in Detroit, Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., and Christine Fernando in East Greenwich, R.I.

BATTLEGROUND ROUNDUP -- “Biden puts Ohio in play,” by Marc Caputo and Natasha Korecki: “Joe Biden’s campaign is making Ohio a battleground again. Buoyed by polls showing him leading President Donald Trump, Biden’s campaign boosted its TV advertising budget to $4.1 million for this month, nearly quadruple what he spent last month and two-thirds of his total ad budget for the state. The day after the first debate with Trump in Cleveland, Biden made his first appearance in Ohio on Wednesday as the Democratic presidential nominee.  “A confluence of forces has made Ohio competitive again in the eyes of Democrats. The economy and health care amid the pandemic are bad. Trump is bleeding white working-class and suburban voters in polls. Conservatives in the state are warring with Republican Gov. Mike DeWine for locking down the state during the pandemic. And DeWine’s Republican predecessor, John Kasich, is backing Biden. ‘We’re going to win Ohio,’ Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) declared in an interview. ‘Biden is the most pro-worker nominee of either party in a generation.’” POLITICO  -- “Democrats Mount an All-Out Effort to Get Detroit to Vote,” by NYT’s Kathleen Gray in Detroit  -- BURGESS EVERETT and JAMES ARKIN: “Liebermans haunt Democrats in key Senate races”  -- TIM ALBERTA in Lake Orion, Mich.: “Has Elissa Slotkin Detected Early Hints of a Biden Blowout?”  MORE GOP CRACKDOWN ON MAIL-IN VOTING -- “Abbott orders counties to close multiple ballot drop-off sites,” by the Austin American-Statesman’s Chuck Lindell and Nicole Cobler: “Gov. Greg Abbott ordered Texas counties Thursday to close multiple locations where voters can drop off completed mail-in ballots. As an election security measure, Abbott said, counties will be limited to one drop-off site where poll watchers — designated by political parties and candidates — must be allowed to observe ballot deliveries by voters.  “The new order takes effect Friday, and it modified Abbott’s July 27 order that acknowledged the pandemic’s danger by adding six days of early voting and waiving a state law that limits mail-in ballot drop-off to Election Day only. Democrats blasted Thursday’s change as a thinly veiled effort to suppress votes in a tight election. ‘Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Gov. Abbott is trying to adjust the rules last minute,’ said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.”  -- “As Trump Sows Doubts on Mail, Democrats Push More In-Person Voting,” by NYT’s Nick Corasanti and Reid Epstein  BIG EYES EMOJI -- “A TV ad tidal wave in Florida: Nearly $250M and counting,” by Gary Fineout in Tallahassee: “Florida’s record-breaking campaign season continues to scale stunning new heights, with the presidential campaigns and their allies preparing to spend at least a quarter of a billion dollars on television ad time between now and Nov. 3.”  ON THE TRAIL -- BIDEN will travel to Grand Rapids, Mich., where he will give a speech on rebuilding the economy at 1:20 p.m. He will attend a virtual fundraiser in the afternoon.

TRUMP isn’t one for equivocation or understatement. So when he tweets from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda that things are “Going well, I think!” it catches our attention.

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CONGRESS seems to be inching toward a Covid relief deal. Here are some details we’ve sussed out over the last few hours:  -- PELOSI and Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN are expected to work through this weekend. Everyone understands that one of the main issues is funding for state and local governments. The last offers traded were Dems offering $436 billion, and Republicans countering at $250 billion. ON THURSDAY, PELOSI and MNUCHIN held a private phone call with Fed Chair JAY POWELL to discuss state and local funding, and municipal lending. This call has not yet been reported, and underscored the lengths to which the two principals are going to try to get a deal.  -- REPUBLICAN SOURCES ARE ALREADY WORRIED THAT MNUCHIN will relent on using ITIN -- a tax ID number -- instead of Social Security numbers to deliver checks to Americans. This is a hot-button issue because Republicans say it allows undocumented immigrants to get checks. This would be a non-starter in the Senate. But sources directly involved in the talks say this hasn’t been discussed at any level -- either staff or principal. BUT this is a good insight into how concerned the GOP is about a potential deal.  BATTLE FOR THE SENATE … RALEIGH NEWS & OBSERVER: “U.S. Senate candidate Cal Cunningham admits to sexual texting with California strategist,” by Brian Murphy: “North Carolina Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Cal Cunningham, a married father of two, sent text messages of a sexual nature to a woman who is not his wife, his campaign confirmed Friday night. The text messages between Cunningham and Arlene Guzman Todd, a public relations strategist from California, were first reported Thursday night by NationalFile.com.  “The report included pictures of the text messages, in which Cunningham and Guzman, who is also married according to the report, talked about kissing each other and more. ‘Would make my day to roll over and kiss you about now,’ said one text message from Cunningham. In one text from Guzman, she says: ‘I have flexibility this month — done with school, training, big RFPs, etc. So the only thing I want on my to do list is you.’ The Cunningham campaign confirmed the authenticity of the text messages.  “Cunningham, who has been leading in polling in his pivotal U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Thom Tillis, said Friday night that he is not dropping out of the race. ‘I have hurt my family, disappointed my friends, and am deeply sorry. The first step in repairing those relationships is taking complete responsibility, which I do. I ask that my family’s privacy be respected in this personal matter,’ Cunningham said in a statement sent to The News & Observer.”  VACCINE LATEST -- WSJ: “White House Takes Issue With FDA’s Plans for Authorizing a Covid-19 Vaccine,” by Thomas Burton: “Senior White House officials have raised objections to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s proposed standards for deciding whether a Covid-19 vaccine should be given widely and don’t appear likely to sign off on the agency’s guidelines, people familiar with the matter said.  “In talks with the FDA in recent days, White House officials expressed a number of concerns about the draft guidelines, including a proposal that would require researchers to monitor study subjects for side effects for two months after getting a shot, the people said.  “The disagreement could put the administration on a collision course with the FDA over whether and when to authorize use of a Covid-19 vaccine, once the late-stage trials that are testing the shots start providing data—perhaps in as little as a few weeks—on how the injections are performing.” WSJ  -- “Warp Speed’s focus on vaccines may have shortchanged antibody treatments,” by Zachary Brennan  UP NEXT -- “Debate commission accedes to Biden campaign’s ‘health and safety’ objections for VP debate,” by Natasha Korecki and Alex Isenstadt: “The Commission on Presidential Debates has agreed to seat Kamala Harris and Mike Pence 12 feet apart at the vice presidential debate next week, after the Biden campaign raised health and safety objections to the original spacing between the two candidates because of Covid concerns.  “As of Friday evening, however, the commission would not accede to the Biden campaign‘s request that Harris and Pence stand during the debate. Instead, the two will be seated, which was the preference of the Trump campaign, a source familiar with the discussions told POLITICO.”  TRUMP’S SATURDAY -- The president has nothing on his public schedule.

Late last month, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the decennial count must continue, ordering that the schedule the Census Bureau’s attempt to wrap up enumeration was inoperative due to the coronavirus pandemic, and counting should extend until the end of October.  “Despite Koh’s ruling, the Bureau issued a brief statement on Monday saying that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ordered the ‘target date’ to ‘conclude 2020 Census self-response and field data collection operations’ was Oct. 5. Koh rejected the Bureau’s decision to cut the count off on Oct. 5, writing that the Bureau was disobeying her original order. She said the Census Bureau was ‘chaotic, dilatory, and incomplete’ in following her original injunction, and issued a clarified injunction, directing the Bureau that it must continue its count through Oct. 31, and publicize its efforts to do so, including texting employees on Friday to inform them.  “On Friday evening, a release from the Bureau said that it had messaged employees to say the count will go on. ‘As a result of court orders, the October 5, 2020 target date is not operative, and data collection operations will continue through October 31, 2020,’ the message read. ‘Employees should continue to work diligently and enumerate as many people as possible.

I want to thank the extraordinary doctors & nurses who cared for me for the last week. Thanks to my family & friends for their prayers. I will have more to say about all of this next week.”  HERE IS A REMARKABLE FACT: President DONALD TRUMP and Speaker NANCY PELOSI haven’t spoken in nearly one year. Their last one-on-one conversation was Oct. 16, 2019 -- they had a brief interaction at the State of the Union, before PELOSI ripped the president’s speech up. In that time period, the nation has been turned upside down, shaken to the core by an unrelenting virus that has killed more 200,000 and hobbled a once vibrant economy.  BUT THROUGH IT ALL, PELOSI and TRUMP have remained distant, unified only in their distaste for one another.  ALL OF THE SUDDEN, though, their incentives are aligned: they both want a massive Covid deal in an unthinkably quick timeframe. This may happen, it may not, but both sides seem to be rowing toward the same goal at the moment. Washington has never negotiated on a package of this magnitude this late into a presidential election year.  TRUMP is unreadable and unplayable for most Washington observers because he, in fact, has no governing theory. But, in recent days, he has apparently decided that it is in his political interest to spend trillions of dollars.  PELOSI has always wanted a big deal, but she’s hung on negotiating with Washington’s most eager man, STEVEN MNUCHIN. She wanted a deal, and MNUCHIN was her only option. (She has no patience for MARK MEADOWS, and the administration has no one else who knows what they’re doing.)  DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK, a deal isn’t all too close at this moment -- meaning as of early Saturday morning. PELOSI sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues saying that the $1.8 trillion offer from the administration was “one step forward, two steps back.” The letter explains where Pelosi finds fault in the GOP offer. State and local funding is “sadly inadequate,” she said, and the two are still $200 billion off in unemployment insurance. This could be a negotiating tactic, but even if so, these are real issues that need to be solved.  IT’S IN PELOSI’S INTEREST to hold out for every last thing, given how eager the TRUMP administration is for a deal.  PELOSI WANTS THIS TOO. On Thursday, during a private phone call with her leadership team, PELOSI revealed another one of her incentives to getting a deal: she thought it would be better to do it now so she didn’t have to do it early in a BIDEN administration.  OF COURSE, STANDING IN THE WAY will be Senate Republicans, who don’t like the size of the bill, have issues with abortion policy and stimulus checks for undocumented immigrants, to name only a sliver of their gripes.  THE ODD bedfellows of PELOSI and the White House also includes the NYT ED BOARD, which said: “Let’s Make a Deal: The nation needs another round of federal aid. President Trump and Congress need to rise to the moment.  FROM NYT’S EMILY COCHRANE and ALAN RAPPEPORT: “During a campaign forum Friday night, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was also in favor of passing another stimulus bill before the election and would be ‘willing to do almost $2 trillion.’ ‘I am excited that Pelosi and Mnuchin are talking again,’ he said. ‘Count me in for another stimulus package.’” WaPo … Sarah Ferris, Marianne Levine and Heather Caygle  NATIONAL FRONTS … NYT (with a big story on last-ditch TRUMP machinations to try to win) … WAPO … WSJ  WHAT AMERICA IS READING … THE NATION’S FRONTS: Charlotte Observer: “Despite his affair, some voters say they are still standing with Cunningham” … Denver Post: “Hickenlooper, Gardner find common ground” … Orlando Sentinel: “Trump coming to Sanford Monday”  10 BYLINES! ...

Biden Jr. — the mother lode of absentee ballots is coming in Dane County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Madison. As of Friday, the number of submitted ballots there amounted to more than 36 percent of the county’s total 2016 election vote, a sign of significant enthusiasm; that figure is 10 percentage points higher than in any other county in the state. …  “The yawning disparities in voting across Wisconsin and several other key battlegrounds so far are among the clearest signs yet this fall that the Democratic embrace of absentee voting is resulting in head starts for the party ahead of Election Day. For Republicans, the voting patterns underscore the huge bet they are placing on high turnout on Nov. 3, even as states like Wisconsin face safety concerns at polling sites given the spikes in coronavirus cases.

MAG’S OLIVIA NUZZI: “The Entire Presidency Is a Superspreading Event: Down in the polls, high on steroids, and clinging to good health while endangering everyone else’s”: “Donald Trump was on the phone, and he was talking about dying. It was Saturday, October 3, and while his doctor had told the outside world that the president’s symptoms were nothing to worry about, Trump, cocooned in his suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, was telling those close to him something very different. ‘I could be one of the diers,’ he said. …  “Persuading him to leave the White House required an intervention from his doctors, members of the White House operations staff, the Secret Service, and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. They had failed to stop the mass deaths of high-risk Americans, but they were going to save Trump, the most important high-risk American of them all. They told him, ‘This isn’t just your choice. This really isn’t about you. It’s about the presidency. Our job is to protect the presidency, and you occupy it.’ They asked him to think about the military and everyone else whose life would be upended if the state of the country’s leadership was in doubt.”  CNN’S MANU RAJU: “Social distancing not common on Senate floor, despite McConnell\\'s claims”  HOLLY OTTERBEIN: “‘Forgotten’ Pennsylvania region holds key to Trump’s fate”: “[President Donald Trump’s] ability to repeat -- or expand on -- his performance in Luzerne County is essential to his hopes of achieving an upset victory in this critical battleground state.  “‘The Luzerne County voter was the definition of the forgotten men and women. Nobody in Washington was standing up for them. They’d lost hope,’ said former GOP Rep. Lou Barletta, a top Trump ally in Pennsylvania who represented a Luzerne-based district. ‘I don’t believe the president lost any support from 2016 here. If anything, he may have even gained more.’ Trump won working-class Luzerne by 26,000 votes in 2016 — nearly 60 percent of his margin of victory in a state that he narrowly carried. As part of his strategy to win Pennsylvania again, his campaign is betting on increased turnout in the small cities and rural reaches of the northeast.”  BLOOMBERG’S JEN JACOBS: “Donald Trump Jr., who self-quarantined after traveling with people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, is planning to take part in 26 campaign events next week on behalf of his father, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.”  THE PRESIDENT’S SATURDAY -- THE PRESIDENT will speak at 2 p.m. at “a peaceful protest for law & order.”  JOE BIDEN’S SATURDAY -- BIDEN will go to Erie, Pa., to talk about “building back the economy better for working families.”  PLAYBOOK READS  PHOTO DU JOUR: A medical team member is disinfected before leaving the Covid-19 ward at the Severo Ochoa hospital in Leganes, outskirts of Madrid, Spain, on Friday, Oct. 9. | Bernat Armangue/AP Photo  ALWAYS, ALWAYS READ MAUREEN DOWD: “James Murdoch, Rebellious Scion”  DANIEL LIPPMAN: “Trump personnel office weighs asking appointees to offer their resignations”: “The White House Presidential Personnel Office is considering asking nearly every political appointee in the Trump administration to write and tender provisional letters of resignation right before the election, according to two senior administration officials.

They'll meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Sen.Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria, according to the trade group.  HOW HOTELS ARE PRESSING FOR A RESCUE: The New York Times’ Eric Lipton and Jeanna Smialek have some new details on hotels’ “aggressive campaign to convince Congress, the Treasury Department and others that the sector will go bust without a big bailout.” The hotels have been lobbying for help with loans that have been packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities. “‘We need you to act — as often as possible — through calls, letters, and social posts to flood the offices of members of Congress,’ the American Hotel & Lodging Association wrote on Thursday in an email to its members.”  — “At a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, a top industry lobbyist said Congress should make a ‘technical amendment’ to an earlier relief package to explicitly allow a Treasury bailout. The committee’s chairman, Senator Michael D. Crapo, who has written two letters in recent months pushing Mr. Mnuchin and the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to act, said during the hearing that the commercial real estate industry, including hotels, was “one of the most significant industries to lack access” to relief funds.” But the push “has put the Trump administration in a tough spot. … Industry lobbyists privately acknowledge that any effort to bail out the industry will generate criticism, given [President Donald] Trump’s dual role as both president and owner of a small luxury hotel brand.”  TRADE GROUP DRAFTED EXECUTIVE ORDER SIMILAR TO THE ONE TRUMP SIGNED: Emails “obtained by ProPublica show that the meat industry may have had a hand in” an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in April meant to keep meatpacking plants open, ProPublica’s Michael Grabell and Bernice Yeung report. “Just a week before the order was issued, the meat industry’s trade group drafted an executive order that bears striking similarities to the one the president signed.”  — “The draft that Julie Anna Potts, the president of the North American Meat Institute, sent to top officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture was written using the framework of an official executive order and stressed the importance of the food supply chain and how outbreaks had reduced production — themes later addressed in the president’s order. … In a statement, Potts said that the meat institute had been working as a liaison between the government and industry on many issues related to COVID-19. ‘Trade associations of all types routinely suggest legislative language, comment on proposed rules, and other provisions that are shared with the government,’ she said.”  TIKTOK DEAL POSES A WASHINGTON CONUNDRUM FOR ORACLE: POLITICO’s Steven Overly reports that Oracle’s partnership with TikTok could put the company “in conflict with its own push for social media regulation in Washington.” Oracle “has both directly and indirectly lobbied to pare down a key set of legal protections that shield internet companies from lawsuits over the content they host.”  — “The protections, afforded under a section of federal law known as Section 230, are considered crucial to companies like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube that host billions of user-generated posts and videos each year. But they’ve been targeted by Oracle and at least one advocacy group funded by Oracle, whose core business until now hasn’t been as reliant on those protections as its competitors.”  — The Wall Street Journal’s Georgia Wells, Aaron Tilley and John McKinnon, meanwhile, unearthed more of the deal’s backstory. One of TikTok’s investors, Sequoia Capital, “used its own connections to push the administration to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., say people familiar with the discussions. Doug Leone, the firm’s global managing partner who took a lead role lobbying on TikTok’s behalf, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates this election season along with his wife, including to the president’s re-election campaign. Mr. Leone also held a reception at his Silicon Valley home for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January.”  JOBS REPORT  — Food Allergy Research & Education has hired Kevin Silard Sr. as senior director of corporate sponsorship.

The nonprofit, called the Empowerment Alliance, was set up last year and is funded by anonymous donors. Terry Holt, a Republican operative whose firm, HDMK, is consulting for the alliance, told PI last year that the group was up against a “flood of left-wing money that would have us virtually shut down” the natural gas industry.  — The Empowerment Alliance has recruited more than 100,000 people to its grassroots network by running digital ads asking voters whether they “stand with President Trump’s American Energy Plan” and warning that Russia and Saudi Arabia are “Trying to Kill American Energy Independence,” according to the group. It’s also persuaded House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and dozens of other Republican lawmakers, governors and state attorneys general to sign a “Declaration of Energy Independence” championing “domestic natural gas discovered, produced, and refined in the U.S.”  — “Though it won’t make the headlines, increasing natural gas production has resulted in lower energy costs for American families while reducing air pollution,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote in an op-ed in July in which he noted he’d signed the nonprofit’s declaration. “And last year, the U.S. led the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, while providing affordable energy to everyone.”  Good afternoon, and welcome to PI.

The trade group is pushing Congress to set up “grant programs or programs with some form of loan forgiveness,” such as a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans and an expansion of the program “that waives the affiliation rule or counts employees by full time equivalents rather than headcount on payroll.”  EMHOFF HEADLINES ‘LAWYERS FOR BIDEN’ EVENT: Sen. Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and her brother-in-law, Tony West, headlined a ‘Lawyers for Biden’ fundraiser on Wednesday that drew more than 700 people, according to a pool report. The event had brought in $960,000 by the time it started. Emhoff is on leave from DLA Piper, where he’s a partner, and West is Uber’s chief legal officer. Jonathan Henes, a partner in Kirkland & Ellis’ New York office, introduced them.  DEJOY TAPS REPUBLICAN LOBBYIST TO AID OUTREACH TO CONGRESS: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told postal officials on Wednesday “that he had selected Peter Pastre, a former Republican congressional aide and insurance lobbyist, to act as a liaison for the agency with Congress and state and local governments, according to people familiar with the discussions,” The New York Times’ Ken Vogel, Hailey Fuchs and Luke Broadwater report. “The move came as the Postal Service was facing mounting political and operational crises. Mr. Trump has raised concerns about the security of voting by mail, and the independent quasi-governmental agency has struggled to overcome a delivery slowdown and a dire financial forecast — all while Democrats accuse Mr. DeJoy and the agency’s Republican-majority governing board of doing the president’s bidding.”  — “Mr. Pastre, who worked in the 1980s as an aide to the Republican former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and made his reputation in Washington as a politically active government relations executive for the insurance industry, was chosen in part because he was seen by Postal Service management as someone who could reach out to Democrats, according to people familiar with the selection process. Mr. Pastre worked for 16 years at MetLife, where he directed the company’s federal political action committee, which has donated more to Republicans in recent years.”  SELF-PROMOTION ISN’T CHEAP: “When Seema Verma, the Trump administration's top Medicaid official, went to a reporter's home in November 2018 for a ‘Girl's Night’ thrown in her honor, taxpayers footed the bill to organize the event: $2,933,” POLITICO’s Dan Diamond and Adam Cancryn report. “When Verma wrote an op-ed on Fox News' website that fall, touting President Donald Trump's changes to Obamacare, taxpayers got charged for one consultant's price to place it: $977. And when consultants spent months promoting Verma to win awards like Washingtonian magazine's ‘Most Powerful Women in Washington’ and appear on high-profile panels, taxpayers got billed for that too: more than $13,000.”  — “The efforts were steered by Pam Stevens, a Republican communications consultant and former Trump administration official working to raise the brand of Verma, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The prices were the amount a consulting company billed the government for her services, based on her invoices, which were obtained by congressional Democrats.”  — “They are among the revelations included in a sweeping congressional investigation chronicling how Verma spent more than $3.5 million on a range of GOP-connected consultants, who polished her public profile, wrote her speeches and Twitter posts, brokered meetings with high-profile individuals — and even billed taxpayers for connecting Verma with fellow Republicans in Congress.”  IF YOU MISSED IT ON WEDNESDAY: “TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is discussing with the U.S. government possible arrangements that would allow the popular video-sharing app to avoid a full sale of its U.S. operations, according to people familiar with the matter,” The Wall Street Journal’s Miriam Gottfried, Georgia Wells and Kate Davidson report. “Discussions around such an option have risen in prominence since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale to a U.S. technology giant like Microsoft Corp. more difficult, the people said. They take place against a fast-approaching deadline that President Trump imposed for TikTok to agree to a sale of its U.S. operations or else be shut down, and as geopolitical wrangling over the app intensifies.”  Jobs Report  — The Canadian quantum-computing company D-Wave Systems has hired Allison Schwartz as its global government relations and public affairs leader.

Quick Fix  Dubbed “the Thurgood Marshall of gender equality law” when she was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s unexpected death on Friday will undoubtedly swing the legal trajectory for cases regarding rights for women and LGBTQ people before the Supreme Court.  Mementos left in a makeshift memorial for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in front of the Supreme Court on September 19, 2020. | Samuel Corum/Getty Images  During the Obama administration, she joined the majority opinion in United States v. Windsor, the 2013 case that struck down a law preventing same-sex couples from receiving the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples, and she sided with the majority in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.  Ginsburg also joined the court\\'s majority in a handful of high-stakes immigration rulings during the Trump administration, such as its surprising 5-4 decision rejecting President Donald Trump’s attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. She also sided against Trump in a 2019 ruling that stopped the administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.  But Trump has since instructed the Commerce Department to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count for the purpose of congressional reapportionment. That effort was blocked by a federal court earlier this month, but the administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court just last week.  Here’s the rub: All of these cases were split along ideological lines, with a conservative member joining the court’s liberals — suggesting that an even greater conservative edge on the Supreme Court will change the outcome on similar issues in the future.  WHAT NOW? Trump wants to fill Ginsburg’s vacancy ASAP, telling thousands of supporters at a campaign rally Saturday that he has a “moral duty” to replace her, and that his pick (to be revealed this week) will be a woman. The shortlist includes: Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, a devout Catholic; former Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Lagoa, now a federal appeals court judge who is Cuban-American; and Allison Jones Rushing, an appeals court judge in her late 30s who would be among the youngest justices ever to serve on the court, according to our Anita Kumar, Marc Caputo and Gabby Orr.  CAN THE SENATE DO THAT? Yes, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that Trump’s nominee will “receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”  BUT, BUT, BUT: Some vulnerable Senate Republicans want to hold off on a vote until after Election Day. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine over the weekend said they oppose moving to fill Ginsburg’s seat immediately. And McConnell can afford to lose only three Republican votes, our Nolan D. McCaskill and Andrew Desiderio report.

Driving the Day  CALIFORNIA STOPS TAKING NEW UNEMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS: California\\'s embattled unemployment agency will undergo a two-week “reset” and will not accept new claims during that time, on the recommendation of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, our Katy Murphy reports.  The Newsom administration released a report Saturday with additional recommendations for the state’s Employment Development Department, such as adopting a commercially available identity verification tool. The suggestions were crafted by a team tasked with reviewing the department\\'s aging IT systems.  Department head Sharon Hilliard estimated that it will take until the end of January to get through the state’s current backlog. She said the agency \"is proactively looking at ways to reduce that timeline” and that if no changes were made the state “would still be working through the current backlog well into July 2021.”  But Hillard said Californians filing new claims will not actually see a delay in their benefit payments, and that many “will actually get their payments faster” thanks to the new identity verification process.  On the Hill  WOLF GETS HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL: The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee has penciled in a hearing Wednesday morning on Chad Wolf’s nomination to permanently lead the Department of Homeland Security.  Wolf, a former lobbyist, has served as the acting head of DHS since November of last year, and his confirmation would give the agency its first Senate-confirmed secretary since Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019.  Legal questions about Wolf\\'s current role in the top spot at DHS will likely come up during the hearing. The Government Accountability Office found last month that he had been invalidly appointed to the role of acting secretary, the result of an improper line of succession.  EEOC NOMINEES IN THE SENATE: McConnell filed cloture last week on a trio of nominees for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, meaning a full confirmation vote is likely this week.  The nominees are Keith Sonderling of DOL’s Wage and Hour Division and Andrea Lucas, to fill the roles of two Republican commissioners, and civil rights attorney Jocelyn Samuels, nominated for a Democratic seat on the commission.  STOPGAP VOTE THIS WEEK? House Democrats are hoping to file a stopgap spending bill by today that would keep the government open through Dec. 11, after congressional leaders missed a self-imposed deadline on Friday to strike a deal, our Caitlin Emma and John Bresnahan report.  House leaders have said they want to vote this week on the continuing resolution, which would extend current government funding levels past Sept. 30 and give them more time to negotiate on a slate of fiscal 2021 spending bills.  WHAT’S AT STAKE: “The measure would tee up a spending standoff during a lame-duck session of Congress, possibly in the middle of a presidential transition,” they write. But passing a dozen fiscal 2021 appropriations bills by Dec. 11 would still be a huge task, as the two parties “remain far apart on a broad swath of spending issues.”  NOT TO MENTION... Congress still remains at an impasse over the next pandemic relief bill, and it’s unclear whether the House or Senate will approve a new tranche of aid before the election. Democrats want to pass at least $2.2 trillion in assistance, while the White House and Republicans are pressing for a lower price tag.  Regulatory Corner  DOL GIG WORKER RULE COMING SOON: The White House budget office has completed review of a DOL proposed rule that would clarify whether gig workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors. OMB wrapped up its review on Friday, meaning the text of the rulemaking should be published soon. The rule will be closely watched by app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and Doordash, as their workers are generally classified as independent contractors who aren’t protected under federal minimum wage and overtime laws.  DON’T FORGET... The timing of the rule would make it vulnerable to repeal under the Congressional Review Act if Democrats were to win the White House and take control of the Senate. (Under that law, Congress can use a fast-track procedure to overturn a regulation issued within the prior 60 legislative days via simple majority votes.)  Unemployment  COVID-19 SPIKES DON’T SHAKE LABOR MARKET: “Large states in the Northeast and West logged some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation in August, while many of their Southern and Midwestern neighbors saw lower rates of joblessness despite significant coronavirus outbreaks over the summer,” Kim Mackrael and Sarah Chaney report for The Wall Street Journal.  “The jobless rate in more than half of states was below the national average of 8.4% in August,” they write, and “many of those states — including Arizona, South Carolina and Texas — recorded a surge in new coronavirus cases during the summer, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.”  Population density also plays a role in state unemployment rates amid the pandemic, according to Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at the investment bank Jefferies LLC. “As people flee large cities, demand for services is declining further in those areas,” she told the Journal. Meanwhile, “states with large, higher-density cities, including California and Illinois, experienced elevated levels of unemployment in August,” Mackrael and Chaney report.  2020 Watch  COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ENDORSE BIDEN: Two dozen award-winning computer scientists said on Friday that they were endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, citing the destructive impact of Trump’s immigration rules on the tech industry, Cade Metz reported for The New York Times.  “The scientists, including John Hennessy, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, are all winners of the Turing Award, which is often called the Nobel Prize of computing,” he writes. “Four of the scientists said the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration rules were a threat to computer research in the United States and could do long-term damage to the tech industry, which for decades has been one of the country’s economic engines.”  Coming up this week  ON TUESDAY: Congress’ Joint Economic Committee will hold a hearing at 2:30 p.m. titled, “The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus.”  ON WEDNESDAY: The House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and citizenship will hold a hearing at 2 p.m. to discuss “immigrants as essential workers during COVID-19.”  ON THURSDAY: The Senate Aging Committee will hold a hearing at 9:30 p.m. on women and retirement to discuss “unique challenges and opportunities to pave a brighter future.”  At 10:30 a.m., the House Small Business Committee will hold a hearing on loan forgiveness, SBA Legacy Systems and inaccurate data related to the Paycheck Protection Program, in 2360 Rayburn.  At 2:30 p.m., the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on “Diversity in America: The Representation of People of Color in the Media.”  ON FRIDAY: The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on restaurants in America during the Covid-19 pandemic at 9 a.m.  At 9:30 a.m., a House Small Business subcommittee will hold a hybrid hearing to review PPP loan forgiveness.

A disaster. A dumpster fire. A train wreck.  That’s how the highly anticipated first presidential debate of 2020 will be remembered — a disorganized 90-plus-minute dogfight between former Vice President Joe Biden and a combative President Donald Trump, who insisted on repeated interruptions and left decorum on the wayside.  And moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News also had a role in the disgrace, failing to get control for nearly the entire 90 minutes of the forum. The jaw-dropping turn of events had even veteran reporters agog. CNN’s Dana Bash gave the most accurate review of the night, live on air: “That was a s---show.”  THE BOTTOM LINE: “Trump mayhem takes over first debate,” by POLITICO’s David Siders: “The mayhem Donald Trump subjected Americans to on Tuesday might have helped him if Joe Biden had disintegrated. Biden didn’t. Trump — and viewers everywhere — just left the night worse off for having sat through the whole, weird thing.”  President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden participate in the first presidential debate Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020. | Olivier Douliery/Pool via AP  But there were some California-centric highlights:  CRAZY CA: After saying he\\'s \"getting along very well with the governor\\'\\' in California, Trump said, \"I\\'m all for electric cars … but what they\\'ve done in California is just crazy.\\'\\' (A statement that came just days after Gavin Newsom signed an executive order mandating that sales of gas-powered cars and trucks will be phased out by 2035.)  RAKING THOSE LEAVES: Asked about California wildfires, Trump said: \"The forest floors are loaded up with trees … and leaves and everything else.\" He added: “Every year I get the call, ‘California\\'s burning, California’s burning.’ If you had good forest management, you wouldn\\'t be getting those calls.” But as @CalMatters noted: “California only owns about 3% of the state\\'s forest. The largest landlord of forestland in California? The federal government.”  ON DEEP-BLUE CITIES: Also on Tuesday night, Trump said, \"Look at Oakland, look what happened in Oakland. … It was more violent than what I’m even seeing now,’’ and blamed Democratic-run cities. What Trump didn’t say: A federal officer was killed in May in Oakland during protests — allegedly by a member of the right-wing ‘boogaloo boys’ who used peaceful protests as a cover, the Washington Post’s Katie Shepherd reported.  HEADLINE OF THE NIGHT: Trump refused to condemn white supremacy, instead saying, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"  KAMALA REACTS: “The president of the United States, in the year of our lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,’’ Kamala Harris told CNN’s Jake Tapper, post-debate.  HOW THEY SAW IT:  ON THE GOP SIDE — Harmeet Dhillon, former vice chair of the California Republican Party and RNC member from CA: “One thing that was very striking to me … was how frequently Chris Wallace came to the aid of Joe Biden, how frequently he interrupted President Trump. … The president did a great job and repeating the successes of his administration and in reflecting those, and in really taking Joe Biden to task for his 47 years of not achieving.’’  ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE — Amelia Matier, former consultant for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and the Pete Buttigieg campaign: “There is no way anyone normal watched it all the way through. Biden looked like the adult in the room and Trump looked unhinged. Trump’s constant interruptions actually helped at a key moment when the moderator asked Biden about abolishing the filibuster and packing the court — Biden didn’t have to answer the question.”  LOCAL ANGLE: “Oaklanders angry at Trump\\'s accusation of \\'violent\\' Oakland,’’ by SFGATE’s Amy Graff.  FROM THE TWITTERSPHERE:  — Stockton Mayor @MichaelDTubbs: “The fact that the President thinks hating racism is the same as hating America is deeply telling of who he is and why he is not fit to lead a multi-racial democracy.”  — Warriors phenom @StephenCurry30: “Stand back and stand by??????????? No further questions your honor! #vote”  — GOP consultant and former Schwarzenegger spokesperson @RobStutzman: “Why would anyone watch two more of these debates?  — Former CA first lady @MariaShriver: “I came into tonight excited and hopeful to see this debate and I have to say I\\'m flabbergasted that was a presidential debate. I\\'m dismayed by what I saw. #PresidentialDebate”  BUENOS DÍAS, good Wednesday morning. It’s the final day for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign or veto bills. Among the measures we’re still waiting on: a hotly contested bill requiring hotel and hospitality businesses to prioritize rehiring workers laid off during the pandemic.  QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The events surrounding Cambridge Analytica are now impossible. … It is just simply no longer possible for that to happen on Facebook.\" Former British deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg — now Facebook’s vice president for global affairs and communications — when asked by POLITICO if a similar data-gathering operation could take place on the platform.  TWEET OF THE DAY: Former California Gov. Arnold @Schwarzenegger after he logged on to a local meeting in Cameron County, Texas to announce his first grant from the University of Southern California’s Schwarzenegger Institute to open more polling places nationwide: “Thank you to Cameron County for applying for a grant! I am so pumped for the voters to have access to these voting super-centers. Like I said, I owe this country everything and this is one of my best investments.”  BONUS TOTD: George Takei @GeorgeTakei: “Eric Trump saying he’s ‘part of the LGBT’ community is like me saying I’m part of the fantasy football community.

The Democratic nominee’s ads excoriate Trump over his handling of a pandemic that is disproportionately affecting people of color, contrasting Biden as the one with a plan, and show the president as mistreating immigrants and refugees.”  CAMPAIGN MODE  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — GOP VOTER stars in new anti-Nunes spot: “I’ve been a Republican all my life, and I voted for Devin Nunes, but decades in Washington has changed him” — that’s the start of a new spot for CA-22 Democratic challenger Phil Arballo that hits the Central Valley today with a six-figure buy.

Quick Fix  President Donald Trump formally announced on Saturday that he has tapped Judge Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.  Barrett, who has served on Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017, is expected to be confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate in the coming weeks. Democrats are planning on throwing a few wrenches into the process, as our Andrew Desiderio reports, but the delay tactics won’t prevent Barrett from being sworn in. Her confirmation hearing, which will last three to four days, will begin Oct. 12, setting the stage for a possible floor vote before Election Day.  Judge Amy Coney Barrett listens as President Donald Trump announces Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. | AP Photo/Alex Brandon  Barrett has already ruled on Trump’s immigration policies during her time on the appeals court. In June, she was the lone judge to dissent in a decision blocking Trump’s public charge rule, which was written to make it harder for immigrants who rely on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs to get green cards and visas. On Sept. 11, another appeals court issued a decision that cleared the Trump administration to implement the rule nationwide.  In 2017, Barrett voted against a request for a rehearing in the discrimination case EEOC v. AutoZone, joining four other judges in denying the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, in which the EEOC alleged the auto parts store was segregating its employees by race.  She also joined in a 2019 ruling that said the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act only covers current employees, not job applicants. The Supreme Court last year declined to take up the case, leaving the 7th Circuit’s ruling in place. More on Barrett from our Josh Gerstein.

DRIVING THE WEEK  NO FORGIVENESS: The $525 billion Paycheck Protection Program, created in March, distributed rescue loans to small businesses, which it stipulated could be forgiven if employers maintained payroll. But “lenders that helped the government deliver the money are warning that the effort is running into new delays and complications that could leave struggling employers on the hook with unanticipated debt,” our Zachary Warmbodt reports.  Banks have been submitting applications for loan forgiveness to the Small Business Administration since Aug. 10, “but the lenders say the agency has been silent on whether any of the applications will be accepted,” Zach writes. The SBA said Thursday it has received 96,000 forgiveness applications — representing fewer than 2 percent of the total loans — but has not approved or denied any of them.  WHAT’S THE HOLDUP? Banks say they have gotten conflicting information from various SBA officials, according to Zach. “Another concern that has surprised borrowers as well as some lenders is a requirement that the proceeds from a separate SBA disaster aid program must be deducted from the amount of the payroll loan that can be forgiven. That means many businesses will likely be left with money to pay back to their bank.”  Immigration  DHS PROPOSES LIMITS ON STUDENT VISAS: The Department of Homeland Security is proposing putting two- and four-year limits on visas for international students, who are currently allowed to stay in the U.S. for as long as it takes to complete their programs, our Eleanor Mueller reports. The Trump administration argues the existing system has \"undermined\" its ability to crack down on students’ \"unlawful presence\" and has \"created incentives for fraud and abuse.”  How it would work: “The time limit would depend on a student\\'s country of origin,” Eleanor writes. “Most would get four years. But a two-year limit would be imposed on those hailing from countries with visa overstay rates of more than 10 percent, including several dozen nations located mostly in Africa and the Middle East. A two-year limit would also apply to students from countries the U.S. considers state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, North Korea, Syria or Sudan.”  What now: The public has 30 days to comment on the proposed changes, and immigration advocates are already criticizing the proposal.  On the Hill  BANKRUPTCY BILL MARKUP THIS WEEK: The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday afternoon will mark up a bill that seeks to strengthen protections for workers during business bankruptcies. The bill, dubbed the “Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2020,” would make changes to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, including tweaks that would make it harder for employers to cut retirement benefits or reject collective bargaining agreements during bankruptcy. A press release on the bill. More on the markup.  In the Workplace  ALPHABET SETTLES WITH SHAREHOLDERS OVER HARASSMENT: Google’s parent company, Alphabet, announced on Friday that it has settled a shareholder lawsuit over its handling of sexual harassment allegation against its executives.  REFRESHER: In January 2019, Google shareholders filed a lawsuit against Alphabet, alleging that the tech giant had violated its fiduciary duties when it shielded and approved large payouts to former executives that had credible sexual harassment allegations against them. Alphabet’s “wrongful conduct allowed the illegal conduct to proliferate and continue,” the suit argued.  WHAT NOW? “Execs will not be able to receive severance or amend their stock sale plans while they are while they are subject to investigations or a lawsuit for sexual misconduct,” CNBC’s Jennifer Elias reports. “The settlement also eliminates mandatory arbitration and limits Google’s use of non-disclosure agreements for employees involved in these cases.” Google has also agreed to spend $310 million “to fund and create a diversity, equity and inclusion advisory council comprised of outside experts,” Elias adds.  More on the tech-giant’s commitments in a post from Google’s head of people operations, Eileen Naughton.  MORE HAZARD PAY AT STOP & SHOP: Grocery chain Stop & Shop will be extending its Covid-19 pay boost for 56,000 unionized employees represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, after initially ending the increase in July. The new agreement, announced by the UFCW on Friday, will give workers retroactive premium pay for hours worked this summer — 10 percent of all their hours from July 5 to August 22.  In the States  PANDEMIC PUSHES CALIFORNIANS DOWN THE LADDER: “Although early government programs might have delayed the hit to California’s already-shrinking middle class, many skilled workers are now downgrading and taking lower wage, essential jobs on the front lines of the pandemic,” Laurence Du Sault reports for The Bay Area News Group.  “There’s so many overqualified people who’ve lost their jobs applying,” said Debra Feleke, the hiring manager for a Safeway district that includes 21 stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to Du Sault. “I’ve had people with doctorates and masters. It’s really quite astounding.”  Economists expect businesses to reopen and employment to rise when more Bay Area counties lift Covid-19 restrictions, Du Sault writes. “But thousands of jobs simply won’t come back. Hardest-hit by early pandemic closures were low-wage workers in the service and retail industries, but as those sectors start rehiring, others are expected to face long-lasting cuts, including DJs, waiters, airport staff, event planners and tour guides.”  Coming up this week  ON WEDNESDAY: The House Small Business Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. to discuss how COVID-19 is impacting small businesses across the food system. 2175 Rayburn.

U.S. intelligence agencies later blamed that breach on a covert Kremlin effort to torpedo the Democratic nominee and help Trump win.  But security researchers, former intelligence officials and lawmakers now worry that the Russians may still have a hand they haven’t played.  “One thing we know that happened in 2016 was Russia, particularly with misinformation and disinformation, tried to exacerbate those divisions that we see play out in real time in America,” Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) told an audience at a cybersecurity conference last week. “I’m very, very concerned in these last 50-plus days whether Russia could try to exacerbate those kinds of racial divisions again.”  In some ways, Russia’s job is easier than it was in 2016. American, Chinese and Iranian copycats are now pumping out falsehoods likely to seed the same divisions and doubts about the legitimacy of the election, often mimicking tactics first deployed by the Kremlin.  And the biggest threat this year may be Americans themselves. Many have embraced a deluge of fringe ideas and misinformation to a degree that may dwarf those foreign efforts. Extremists in the U.S. have adopted much of Moscow’s online strategy, including creating fake online personas to pump out falsehoods. Case in point: The QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges a plot by elite pedophiles and the “deepstate” to overthrow Trump, has gone so mainstream it’s poised to send adherents to Congress.  “The scale, scope and, most importantly, the impact of domestic disinformation is far greater than any foreign government could do to the United States,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which tracks online influence campaigns — and was itself the victim of recent Russian cyberattacks.  “Russia is continuing to evolve its tactics,” he added. “But the playing field has shifted since 2016.”  Worst-case scenarios  The question of what exactly Russia is up to has spawned a political brawl in Washington, where congressional Democrats have accused the Trump administration of failing to disclose all it knows about the Kremlin’s activities. They also say the president is pushing a false narrative that this year’s most potent election threat comes from China, which Trump contends favors Biden. Intelligence officials have told POLITICO that no evidence backs up those claims.  Still, Trump’s top counterintelligence official, William Evanina, has agreed that Moscow is seeking to attack the election. He told lawmakers last month that Russia aims to “denigrate” Biden “and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment.” Those efforts — plus influence campaigns by China and Iran — are \"a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy,\" he said in an earlier statement.  Last week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on four individuals, including Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawyer with ties to Trump, accusing them of being active Russian agents. In particular, the U.S. accused Derkach of leaking doctored audiotapes aimed at discrediting Biden.  “The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to counter these Russian disinformation campaigns,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Still, social media posts about those recordings have drawn millions of views among mostly Trump supporters after the president and his allies promoted them, The Associated Press reported Saturday.  Ten U.S. and international national security officials, misinformation experts and tech executives who spoke to POLITICO said their major concerns include a hack of either campaign coming to light only days before Nov. 3. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss national security matters.  That would mirror not only the months of anti-Clinton leaks from 2016, but also the run-up to France’s 2017 presidential election, when Russian hackers released reams of internal documents from Emmanuel Macron’s campaign.  No such leaks have yet been made public in this election. Senior U.S. national security and intelligence officials say they also have seen no new Russian efforts to hack the nation’s election infrastructure, such as voting machines, election device vendors and state voter databases.  But officials warned that Moscow is engaging in information warfare through a combination of attempted social media manipulation, old school propaganda and other dirty tricks.  Conspiracy theories like QAnon and racial divisions stoked by right-wing extremists online appear to be making it more difficult for Russia’s direct campaigns to gain massive followings, with recently exposed Kremlin efforts garnering limited traction with social media users.  But if Moscow still intends to try to weaken the U.S. by generating doubt around the election itself, such homegrown falsehoods would help achieve that goal, according to misinformation experts.  Moscow forced to evolve  Another change from 2016: Tougher oversight by social media companies and increased awareness from U.S. security agencies about Russia’s tactics have forced the Kremlin’s operatives to step up their game.  Before the 2016 election, the Internet Research Agency — a St. Petersburg-based propaganda outfit with ties to the Russian government — was able to buy political ads on Facebook, some of them in rubles, and create fake social media profiles that drew widespread followings around posts on both sides of issues like America’s racial divisions and the country’s treatment of immigrants.  But some of those doors have closed.  After receiving widespread criticism for their 2016 failings, Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube have spent the past two years removing millions of misleading posts and so-called bot networks of fake accounts controlled by Russian operatives. They have also limited the ways Kremlin-owned media outlets can spread their messages online.  On Sept. 1, Facebook and Twitter announced their latest attempts at curbing Russia’s influence by removing a handful of accounts and social media pages linked to an Internet Research Agency campaign to target progressive voters with a fake news website that pumped out left-leaning articles.  Seeking to evade the hunt for fake accounts, the IRA used artificial intelligence to create photos of non-existent people, then built social media personas with those images to push news articles to left-minded online groups, the two companies said. Most strikingly, the IRA also hired freelance journalists to write for a bogus online news outlet called PeaceData that promoted causes favored by Russia, such as attacks on Belarus’ opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, and U.S. foreign policy toward Venezuela.  The elaborate tactics highlight how much harder it has become for Russia’s misinformation campaigns to reach Americans on social media, said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, an analytics firm that worked with Facebook on the recent takedown.  But even the new methods did not guarantee success. PeaceData’s English-language social media presence, for instance, failed to gain traction in the U.S. before it was outed as a Kremlin front, garnering just 200 followers after creating its Facebook page in mid-May.  “If you’re running a fake operation, trying to achieve success when you don’t have any real friends is tough,” said Nimmo, who has tracked the IRA’s activities for years. “The underlying reality is that it’s harder to conduct a successful campaign than you may think.”  POLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Russia’s U.S. targets  Still, misinformation experts and national security officials say Moscow is again targeting the same voters as in both the 2016 presidential race and 2018 midterm elections.  The goal: to suppress turnout among disaffected Democratic voters and galvanize Trump supporters to head to the polls.  Last October, for instance, Facebook removed 50 IRA-linked Instagram accounts that had posed as Republican voters and progressive Democrats, according to a review by the social media company and Graphika.  Under usernames like “Confederate Virginia” and “Stop.Trump2020,” Russian operatives — often pretending to be voters in crucial swing states — copied viral memes like images of liberal Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) allegedly promoting anti-Israeli causes from other accounts. They also posted incendiary slogans and calls-for-action on both sides of issues like Black Lives Matter and garnered almost 250,000 followers collectively before the accounts were shut down.  In March, Facebook and Twitter also took down a similar Russian-backed campaign that tricked unsuspecting social media users in Ghana to target African Americans in the U.S. with viral posts depicting police brutality against minorities, including an image of officers allegedly arresting a 6-year-old boy, and calling Trump a racist.  Most of that content was not linked to the 2020 election, according to a review of the fake online content by Graphika. But tech executives and misinformation experts said the campaign had been aimed at building an online following that could then switch to more explicit political content closer to November.  “These types of operations are getting caught earlier and before they have an impact compared to what happened in the past,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy. Then again, he added, “The threat actors will keep on innovating.”  \\'Russia doesn’t need to be successful in everything\\'  With weeks left before November’s vote, Russia is not limiting itself to covert tactics.  Over the past two months, the Kremlin has used its extensive state media operations like RT and Sputnik to pump out political messages to both progressive voters and Trump supporters, according to a POLITICO review of these outlets\\' social media activities.  Since the beginning of the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, for instance, the Kremlin-backed outlets published articles and op-eds attacking Biden for policies like his support for the Iraq War, and claimed that Barack Obama expressed doubt that his former running mate could win the presidency.  Those stories collectively reached thousands of online users, according to a review of activity on CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool that analyzes people’s engagement on social media. That represents a fraction of the reach of traditional news outlets’ coverage of the convention, but still allowed Russia to get its message to social media users across the U.S.  The Kremlin’s aim was to sow doubts in the minds of progressive voters, particularly those who had initially backed Bernie Sanders, about whether Biden was worth supporting, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States\\' Alliance for Securing Democracy, a think tank in Washington.  The Marshall Fund was one of more than 200 organizations, businesses and people targeted by Russia’s recent hacking efforts, Microsoft said last week.  “It’s a quintessential voter suppression campaign,” Schafer added.  A week later, just as the Republican convention was getting underway, the same Russian media outlets began peddling articles to promote Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that mail-in voter fraud was a widespread problem. Kremlin operatives have been pushing similar pro-Trump messages about voter fraud since at least March, according to an intelligence bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security obtained by ABC News.  That message has continued into September, with articles from RT and Sputnik promoting mail-in fraud accusations garnering, collectively, thousands of comments and shares across social media, according to POLITICO’s analysis of CrowdTangle data.  “What we’re seeing in the U.S. is what Russia has done elsewhere,” said a veteran European national security official, who has tracked the Kremlin’s disinformation activities across multiple elections worldwide since 2016. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak publicly on security matters linked to Russia.  “The key is that Russia doesn’t need to be successful in everything that it does,” the official added. “Just the fact that it’s pushing these falsehoods can be enough to muddy the waters before an election.”  Natasha Bertrand and Martin Matishak contributed to this report.'}\n",

There are overnight closures to clean and disinfect cars, but experts point out that contaminated surfaces are not the main risk for catching the coronavirus — instead, it’s lots of people packed into enclosed spaces. So there’s a bit of a paradox here: the emptier the subways are, the safer they are, the more people feel safe enough to take them, the riskier they may become. But most experts agree that compliance with mask requirements is key to keeping riders safe, while the MTA understands that perception is part of its problem.  Masks have been required on subways and buses since April, and the MTA says 90 percent of riders are already following the rules — though the transit workers union and journalists have reported much lower compliance on certain routes. “This is targeting a small population of folks who are refusing to wear a mask,” New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg said. “Even if it’s just one or two people in the system, they do not have the right to endanger anyone else. And frankly, they don’t have the right to scare anyone away from the system.”  The new penalties, which will also apply on LIRR and MetroNorth, follow an order from Cuomo to boost mask-wearing compliance. Still, it’s not yet clear just how rigorous the latest enforcement blitz will be. The MTA says it will not direct transit workers to issue fines, and will instead rely on MTA police and the NYPD, which stopped giving summonses months ago for failures to wear a mask, and has itself been the subject of frequent complaints about police officers not covering their faces.  IT’S FRIDAY and the 19th anniversary of 9/11. The pandemic has refreshed memories of New Yorkers coming together in the kind of grief we had hoped we’d never experience twice in two decades. Take a few moments to reflect and be kind to your neighbors — and the people who aren\\'t. Thank your first responders, especially those who may still be paying the price for years to come, and remember the strength of a community that looks out for one another.

No public schedule by press time.  WHERE’S BILL? Attending the 9/11 commemoration ceremony.  ABOVE THE FOLD: “IN A YEAR when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged. The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the Sept. 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at the observance on the memorial plaza....In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly canceled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar restored the tribute. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters. Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to ‘Never Forget’ is fading.” The Associated Press’ Jennifer Peltz  — 9/11 responder groups are pitching in to help essential workers with protective equipment and food during the pandemic.  — “Coronavirus attacked more stealthily, spreading almost unnoticed until suddenly, it seemed to have the entire city in its grip. It eclipsed the 9/11 death toll in early April. Now, the comparison is not even close. As of September 9, coronavirus has killed almost nine times as many people in New York City (23,741) as the World Trade Center attacks (2,753). And while the terror attacks crippled the city’s economy, the economic fallout pales in comparison to 2020.” NY1’s Bobby Cuza  — “[T]he attack on the World Trade Center created a definitive physical scar — a hole in the ground, a space in the skyline — from which the city could rebound and rally around. The impact of the virus has been more pervasive and systemic, Mr. Vaz said, making the city’s path to recovery less clear.” New York Times’ Michael Gold  — “The Children of 9/11 Are About to Vote,” by Garrett M.

Time for New York to follow, see how here.      WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “MORE THAN 150 powerful business leaders in New York City joined together on Thursday to implore Mayor Bill de Blasio to address public safety and other quality-of-life issues that they said were jeopardizing the city’s economic recovery. Chief executives of companies like Goldman Sachs, Vornado Realty Trust and JetBlue sent a letter to the mayor portraying a bleak assessment of life in New York City during the pandemic, and suggesting a vote of no confidence in the mayor’s ability to correct it. The letter asserted that there was ‘widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues that are contributing to deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs.’ And if the mayor did not address those issues, the business leaders warned that people who have left the city would be slow to return because of legitimate concerns over ‘security and the livability of our communities.’” New York Times’ Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Dana Rubinstein  THE LEGAL AID Society is preparing to sue the de Blasio administration over its plan to move homeless New Yorkers with disabilities out of an accessible shelter in Midtown so it can make room for the homeless men the mayor kicked out of the Lucerne Hotel on the Upper West Side, the group said Thursday. The Harmonia shelter on 31st Street is a family facility where 80 percent of the people it serves have disabilities. In order to accommodate those moved out of the Lucerne, residents at the Harmonia will be scattered to other shelters around the city, the legal advocacy group said. POLITICO’s Janaki Chadha  — “‘My husband and I are in wheelchairs, okay? And I’m on oxygen,’ said Glenda Harris, 56, who has lived at the Harmonia since February 2018. ‘Last minute, they tell us we have to leave,’ Harris exasperatedly told the Daily News . Harris and her husband, Frank Reichard, were told Wednesday that they’d be moved by the end of the week to a shelter in Canarsie, Brooklyn... Harris suffers from Antiphospholipid syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can result in blood clotting. She says the illness amounts to a death sentence if she catches Covid-19.” New York Daily News’ Noah Goldberg and Molly Crane-Newman  MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO split with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s plan to allow indoor dining in New York City, saying he wanted a later opening date and a firm requirement to shut restaurants back down if infection rates rise. De Blasio said Wednesday that a deal was still in the works between the city and the state to green light indoor dining. About an hour later, he said Cuomo’s office informed City Hall that they planned to go ahead with an announcement without him. It’s the latest disagreement between the two rival pols on how to manage the coronavirus pandemic… Cuomo cleared indoor restaurants to reopen on Sept. 30 with 25 percent of their usual tables... He’s pushing for a rule that would require indoor dining to stop if the city’s positive test rate hits 2 percent on a seven-day rolling average. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin  — Fitness studios sued the city over rules requiring them to stay closed.  TIFFANY Cabán, the former public defender who narrowly lost a hard-fought primary for Queens district attorney, announced she would run for City Council in the same Astoria bar where she conceded defeat just over a year ago. Cabán is seeking to win a Council seat that represents western Queens, an area that has become increasingly politically aligned with the progressive movement that voted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into Congress... Flanked by state Sens. Jessica Ramos and Michael Gianaris, along with Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, Cabán introduced herself as a queer Latina who was running out of a love for the borough she grew up in. POLITICO’s Danielle Muoio  “EARLY IN JUNE, when New York City was just entering phase one of its economic ‘reopening’ and the city still had daily triple-digit coronavirus death counts, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an ambitious plan, the Better Bus Restart Initiative, to add 20 more miles of bus lanes and five new busways by October, in addition to making the 14th Street busway permanent. While this plan, offered during a unique opportunity to rethink city street use, did not go as far as many public officials and advocates would have liked, it was a significant move by a mayor who has paid limited attention to the city’s buses, ridden by about 388,000 people, mostly low-income people of color, each weekday before the pandemic hit. Now, just over three months later, only four of the nine announced bus projects — five busways and four extended bus lanes — have been completed .” Gotham Gazette’s Andrew Millman  — A purported crackdown against parking placard abuse has not revoked a placard from a single city employee.      WHAT ALBANY\\'S READING  “THE $300 a week in additional unemployment benefits for New Yorkers impacted by COVID-19 will start to go out next week, the state Department of Labor said late Thursday. About 2.4 million residents will be eligible retroactively for the additional weekly unemployment benefits for three weeks in August under the Lost Wages Assistance program, the agency said. And 435,000 of them will need to submit an additional certification to qualify for the $300. ‘We are emailing all New Yorkers who are receiving benefits to inform them of their status and, if needed, provide information about certifying for the Lost Wages Assistance program,’ labor commissioner Roberta Reardon said in a statement.” USA Today Network’s Joseph Spector  “NEW YORK’S new online system for obtaining absentee ballots received more than 220,000 requests in its first week — about half of all absentee ballots sought during the entire 2016 presidential campaign, according to the state Board of Elections. For the first time, the state has provided a way for registered voters to apply online for absentee ballots that they then can mail in or drop off at early voting sites, local boards of election or at polling places on Election Day. Earlier this year, the state Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo changed state election law to allow online applications for voters concerned about the spread of the coronavirus at polling places. The online system started last Wednesday.” Newsday’s Mike Gormley  — Thousands of New York voters who applied for an absentee ballot prior to Aug. 20 by claiming \"temporary illness\" will have to reapply.  “MIDDLE- AND HIGH-SCHOOL students in the state’s capital city would have had the option of some classroom time this fall semester under the district’s reopening plan. But those plans were scrapped a week before schools opened — not on account of the new coronavirus, but because of a reduction in state funding. The City School District of Albany voted late on Tuesday to lay off 222 employees and scrap plans to offer in-person instruction to students in grades 7 to 12. The sudden change frustrated parents and teachers in the district, who said they feared recent immigrants, refugees and other at-risk students would be adversely affected. Albany’s layoffs were some of the first direct fallout from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration withholding $300 million in aid from districts across New York over the summer as the state grapples with a $14.5 billion deficit that stems in large part from the coronavirus pandemic. Because some schools are more reliant on state grants than others, these cuts have disproportionately affected urban districts in the Capital Region and elsewhere, education officials say.” Wall Street Journal’s Jimmy Vielkind  — New York health officials are considering requiring flu vaccines for students returning to classrooms in New York.  — In higher education, SUNY Albany has seen a recent coronavirus outbreak that could halt in-person classes for the fall if “not addressed immediately,” the university president said.  #UpstateAmerica: It’s the most wonderful time of the year.

TRUMP\\'S NEW YORK  “THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION has secretly siphoned nearly $4 million away from a program that tracks and treats FDNY firefighters and medics suffering from 9/11 related illnesses, the Daily News has learned. The Treasury Department mysteriously started withholding parts of payments — nearly four years ago — meant to cover medical services for to firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics treated by the FDNY World Trade Center Health Program, documents obtained by The News reveal. The payments were authorized and made by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which oversees the program. But instead of sending the funds to the city, the agency started keeping some of the money.” New York Daily News’ Michael McCauliff  “A FEDERAL COURT ruled Thursday that President Trump’s order to exclude undocumented immigrants from census numbers for apportioning congressional districts is unlawful. A unanimous three-judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said in its decision that Trump\\'s executive memorandum violates the executive branch\\'s ‘constitutional responsibility to count the whole number of persons in each State and to apportion members of the House of Representatives among the States according to their respective numbers.’” The Hill’s Harper Neidig  — “New York City is racing against the clock to count as many residents as possible for the U.S. Census, raising fears that a significant slice of the population will be left unaccounted for, costing the city crucial federal resources for the next decade.”  ... 2020 VISION ...  MINOR PARTIES have long enjoyed a uniquely significant role in the state’s political process, thanks in part to fusion voting. But because of a new law that came about after years of feuding between Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Working Families Party, those parties could be relegated to irrelevance after November\\'s election. They are all scrambling to ensure that doesn\\'t happen. The rules governing minor parties have been pretty straightforward since the 1930s: If they got 50,000 votes in a gubernatorial election, they enjoyed four years’ worth of perks such as looser campaign finance limits, automatic ballot status in statewide races and special elections, and state-funded primaries. Now, they’ll need to hit a total of either 130,000 votes or 2 percent of the electorate, whichever is higher. They’ll need to hit this mark in every presidential and gubernatorial contest, instead of just the gubernatorial one. Here’s where the state’s minor parties plans are as they attempt to drive up their vote totals in November’s presidential election. POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney  FROM THE DELEGATION  “SEN. MINORITY LEADER Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) denounced the Republican’s much-ballyhooed ‘skinny’ economic relief bill on Thursday for abandoning New York’s mass transit and their ridership during a fiscal and health crisis unseen for nearly a century. Schumer angrily decried the GOP for giving a legislative middle finger to the Metropolitan Transit Authority and other mass transit systems, which have experienced catastrophic declines in ridership during the pandemic. ‘The Republican bill flatlined New York, it flatlined the MTA, it flatlined the working people who ride public transportation every day,’ Schumer told the News. He said the GOP showed its true colors by including ignoring the multi-billion dollar budget crisis faced by mass transit agencies like the MTA.” New York Daily News’ Dave Goldiner      AROUND NEW YORK  — “Children in pediatric nursing homes who haven’t been able to hug or kiss their parents for six months will have an easier path to family visits,” with new coronavirus guidance from the state.  — At least 16 school staffers have now tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the teachers union.  — A number of top Department of Education officials have stepped down as the city attempts to pull off its school reopening.  — One in five city teachers have been approved for exemptions to work from home this year.  — Midwood residents filed a lawsuit seeking to stop a city charter school serving at-risk, mostly Black teens from operating out of the East Midwood Jewish Center.  — WEST INDIAN AMERICAN DAY: “‘It’s Like Church to Us’: A Brooklyn Tradition Goes On ”  — Shelter Island’s north and south ferries are facing uncertainty during the pandemic.  — A judge tossed the felony drug conviction of a man found guilty of moving heroin through the Capital Region, saying Albany County prosecutors acted irresponsibly during the trial.  — “The Secret History of America’s Only WWII Refugee Camp,” via NYT: “At the height of the war, 982 refugees fleeing the Nazis were invited by President Roosevelt to a converted military base in upstate New York.”  SOCIAL DATA BY DANIEL LIPPMAN  HAPPY BIRTHDAY: former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, a partner at Paul, Weiss, is 63 … Maria Bartiromo, global markets editor and anchor at Fox News and Fox Business Network … Emily Esfahani Smith ...

As you may have noticed, almost everything kind of sucks.  The U.S. budget deficit tripled this year to $3.3 trillion, by far the highest ever. The U.S. economy shrank at a 31.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, by far the worst ever. The trade deficit is at its highest level in 12 years. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level in six years. Unemployment claims, which had never topped 700,000 in a week before March, have topped 700,000 every week since March. Farm bankruptcies are rising, even though government payments to farmers are at an all-time high. Homicides are rising in America’s cities after decades of decline, while a series of police killings of unarmed Black Americans has triggered anguished protests and civil unrest. The West Coast is on fire, and 2020 may turn out to be the hottest year in recorded history. America’s reputation abroad is the worst it’s been since the Pew Research Center began doing international surveys.  In related news, a virus that has already killed 200,000 Americans is still spreading in much of the country, even though it’s mostly under control in most of the rest of the world. Now the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, less than two months before an election that was already inflaming some rather scary tensions, has created a potential constitutional crisis, while President Donald Trump is refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election to Joe Biden.  Voters are already starting to vote, and the president is already proclaiming that the election is going to be riddled with fraud, which is not so awesome.  On the other hand … let’s see ... Hamilton is streaming on Disney Plus?  It was back in 2014 that I wrote an essay for the new year called “Everything Is Awesome,” after Republicans won a landslide in the midterm elections by proclaiming that everything was awful, the economy was collapsing, and an Ebola pandemic was about to kill us all. In fact, the economy was growing at an impressive rate, Ebola ended up killing a grand total of two Americans, and statistically, just about everything was getting better, which is why I stole the title of The Lego Movie’s theme song to highlight the vast gap between the rhetoric and reality. I wrote new versions of the essay every year, my dorky way of trying to add some holiday cheer to a gloomy political culture. Politics changed dramatically in the next few years, with Donald Trump describing America as a dystopian hellscape as a candidate and then as the most spectacular economy ever as president, but the statistical trajectory barely changed at all.  The January 2019 installment was a bit less upbeat, and included a warning that “this might be the final edition of this holiday tradition.” The economy was still pretty fabulous—highest consumer confidence in two decades, lowest unemployment in five decades—but it just felt like America was “slouching toward non-awesomeness,” like “things are going to reach some kind of breaking point.” The headline was “Yes, 2019 Is the Year You Were Worrying About.”  Sue me, I was off by a year.  The main point of the Awesome tradition was never about politics. It was about gratitude, about our inability to count our blessings. It was a data-driven version of the Louis C.K. riff that “everything is amazing and nobody is happy.” It felt important to document the objective improvements in our national well-being, in light of our national tendency to kvetch about spotty airplane Wi-Fi instead of appreciating the miracle of flight. Most Americans now view the state of the union through a partisan lens, as if economic growth under a president you don’t like isn’t really growth. But statistics, and well-being, ought to be apolitical.  Unfortunately, now that things are no longer amazing—even Louis C.K. was cancelled—and the election is coming soon, it’s hard to avoid the political implications of our national nightmare. After making a thriving America sound like it was on the brink of death in 2016, Trump is now making a bleeding America sound like it’s only got a flesh wound in 2020. He’s arguing that Covid-19 is under control when it’s still killing 1,000 Americans every day, that the economy is an incredible comeback story when it has shed 11.5 million jobs this year—and, rather perversely, that whatever mayhem might be erupting on his watch only illustrates the dangers of Joe Biden’s America.  Usually, when presidents run for reelection, the key question is whether Americans are better off than they were four years earlier. In 1984, 1996 and 2012, the answers under Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Obama were clear yeses; in 1980, America told Jimmy Carter hell no; 1992 and 2004 were closer calls, with George H.W. Bush losing but George W. Bush winning. The electoral landscape of 2020 looks a lot less straightforward, and a lot more frightening.  Presidents inevitably take too much credit for the good stuff that happens while they’re in the White House, and their critics inevitably assign them too much blame for the bad stuff. But since this series always focused on the stuff itself, rather than the spin about the stuff—and since Trump rose to power as one of those finger-pointing critics—it seems like a moment to take stock of where we were and where we are one last time, now that the stuff has hit the fan.  Let’s start with the good stuff, because there is some.  The strength of the stock market, for example, reflects genuine investor confidence in the U.S. economy, or at least in the big businesses that make up the major exchanges. It doesn’t necessarily reflect confidence in the U.S. president, even though this one brags about it all the time; the Dow nearly tripled under President Barack Obama, while it’s up less than 50 percent under Trump. But the positive trend line has continued in the Trump era, despite some wild volatility evocative of the man himself, and while it’s true the current bull market reflects the Federal Reserve’s hyperaggressive interventions to extend credit to corporate behemoths during the pandemic, that’s a good thing, too. America’s central bank has done an awesome job propping up the economy, despite frequent norm-busting complaints from Trump that it wasn’t propping it up aggressively enough, and at a time when confidence in so many elite institutions is hemorrhaging, it’s a relief that the smart money still trusts the Fed.  One difficulty with assessing good stuff that’s happened in the past four years is that Trump tends to exaggerate its goodness to ludicrous proportions, while concocting an alternative reality about how horrific things were before it. But good stuff is still good. For example, the “New NAFTA” trade deal that Trump negotiated with Mexico and Canada looks a lot like the old NAFTA, which Trump routinely bashed as the worst trade deal in history. But it did include some modest concessions from Mexico on labor issues and from Canada on dairy issues—as did Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump scuttled, but still—and it averted the disastrous trade war that Trump had vowed to launch if it didn’t pass. The new U.S.-Korea trade deal also looks a lot like Obama’s U.S.-Korea trade deal that Trump had blamed for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, but it could help American carmakers get slightly better access to the Korean market, and the major stakeholders all seem fine with the outcome, compared with a descent into protectionism.  Similarly, Trump hyped the recent news that the Gulf states United Arab Emirates and Bahrain are establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel as huge steps towards peace in the Middle East, when they are quite small steps—and after Trump was captured on tape bragging to Bob Woodward that he had shielded the Gulf state Saudi Arabia from scrutiny after the murder of a Washington Post journalist, it’s understandable that some critics are skeptical about U.S. motivations. But small steps are still steps. And speaking of small steps, while Trump doesn’t talk much about criminal justice reform these days—he talks about unleashing the criminal justice system on anti-police-brutality protesters and other political opponents—the bipartisan First Step Act he signed into law was a genuine first step away from mass incarceration.  The dark clouds above us these days tend to overshadow the silver linings, but that doesn’t mean the Silver Linings genre of good news is fake news. For example, the climate emergency is real, constantly fueling new fires and storms and temperature records, but the clean energy revolution that can help alleviate the emergency is also real. Three-quarters of the world’s new electricity generation last year was renewable, and the U.S. has now retired 60 percent of its coal plants in a decade; despite Trump’s aggressive efforts to boost the coal industry, it’s been vanishing even faster on his watch than it did on Obama’s. And the oil industry has written off $90 billion in assets this year—partly because of the unfortunate coronavirus-related drop in short-term demand, but partly because it senses a greener long-term future ahead.  It’s even possible to see a few upsides in the coronavirus catastrophe, if you squint. There will probably be much less unnecessary business travel and much more part-time telecommuting now that the world has learned how to Zoom; it also might be the end of school cancellations on school days, which is good news for parents, if not for students. And as corny as it sounds, the disruptions and lockdowns of the past six months have helped clarify what is and isn’t important in life, helping a lot of us appreciate ordinary things we might have taken for granted in the past.  Including the United States of America. Even in these non-awesome times, a lot of us still have a lot to be thankful for. Inflation remains low. There hasn’t been a run on the dollar even though our government has printed unprecedented quantities of dollars. Supermarkets are stocked, and you can get just about anything you want delivered tomorrow with a single click. This may not be a great moment for public health or public safety, for our climate or our democracy, but we’re not Venezuela or Belarus or Somalia or Bangladesh.  Which is, let’s face it, a low bar to clear for the nation that’s supposed to be the beacon to the world. Enough with the gratitude. Let’s get to the suckitude.  “Great Jobs Numbers!” Trump tweeted after the U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August. Unemployment had dropped to 8.4 percent, its first time below double digits since April. “Wow, much better than expected!” the president declared.  Yeah, well, the Portland Trail Blazers did better than expected against the Los Angeles Lakers, but they still lost four out of five games. Businesses have rehired some of the workers they laid off this spring, but overall, the U.S. economy has still lost more jobs in 2020 than were lost in the entire Great Recession. There are more Americans receiving food stamps than there were before Trump took office, even though his administration has made it harder to qualify, and food pantries have still faced unprecedented demand. Foreign travel to the U.S. may fall by more than half this year, while Americans still aren’t even allowed to travel to most foreign countries.  That’s not great, and the numbers would look even worse if Congress hadn’t deployed the national credit card to provide $4 trillion worth of economic relief this spring. Congress could make the numbers look better by pumping even more stimulus into the economy, and the Democratic House did pass a $3 trillion bill to bail out cash-strapped states and families in May, but the Republican Senate has yet to pass anything. Gridlock rules in Washington, which is also not great. State and local governments are hemorrhaging cash. As the president likes to say: Sad!  Trump and his surrogates keep suggesting the pandemic-induced recession shouldn’t really count toward his economic record, because he had turned a stagnant economy into the greatest economy in American history before COVID-19 temporarily interrupted all the winning. In fact, the economy was growing at a decent rate and adding 200,000 jobs a month before he became president; it continued to grow and add jobs at a similar rate in the first three years of his presidency. The manufacturing sector that he promised to revive actually slipped into recession before the pandemic—and the number of Americans without health insurance, which had declined by 20 million during the Obama years, had risen by more than 2 million under Trump. Still, it’s true that unemployment, which had dropped to 4.7 percent by the end of Obama’s second term, kept dropping to 3.5 percent under Trump until the virus began wreaking havoc.  In any case, the virus absolutely counts. The countries that did what they needed to do to control it—like New Zealand and Taiwan and Germany and even Canada next door—now have their daily death count down to single digits and their economies more or less back. The United States didn’t, so we don’t. We didn’t launch a massive public health campaign with on-demand testing, vigorous contract tracing, mandatory quarantines and universal mask-wearing. It’s telling that the National Basketball Association did all those things inside its Orlando bubble, and none of its personnel have gotten the virus during the playoffs, but the rest of the country hasn’t followed its lead, so our daily deaths are in the quadruple digits. Trump thinks that’s got nothing to do with him, but the leaders of the nations that beat the virus didn’t downplay it as an ordinary flu that would miraculously go away, or hold indoor rallies for unmasked fans, or pressure state and local officials to open schools and businesses, or cheer on protesters who screamed that coronavirus mandates were tyranny. And those leaders had plans.  The economic numbers today are obviously better than they were in April, after the virus vaporized 20 million jobs, but when you’re only halfway out of a hole, you’re still in a hole. And when we do climb out—assuming we eventually do contain the virus—we’ll have to confront some troubling statistical hangovers. It’s appropriate to borrow and spend during a downturn, but it’s still unnerving that the national debt will be bigger than the economy next year for the first time since World War II. The Highway Trust Fund is projected for insolvency in 2022, the Medicare trust fund perhaps as early as 2023, and the Social Security retirement fund by 2031, which could inspire demands for fiscal austerity that could drag down the recovery. The Fed’s aggressive monetary stimulus has also been appropriate in tough times, but its balance sheet has ballooned above $6 trillion, up 700 percent since 2007, with no plan to unwind it.  For now, though, the virus is still the overarching economic problem, because the recovery will keep sputtering as long as it’s mucking up the engine. Of course, it’s also a health problem, with more than 7 million Americans already infected, and a child development problem, especially for low-income kids who rely on school lunches for nutrition and have trouble logging into online classes.  In other suboptimal news, 2020 is already the worst wildfire season in the history of California, burning more than 3.4 million acres of the state; the same is true for Oregon, which had the world’s worst air quality last week. Some Westerners now need to wear masks indoors, too. Meanwhile, the beleaguered National Hurricane Center tracked five Atlantic cyclones at once last week for the first time in half a century; it’s had to deal with so many named storms this year that it ran out of letters in the alphabet to name them, and has started using the Greek alphabet. This is the new abnormal on a warmer planet, where we’ll keep having to add words like “firenado” and “derecho” to our weather vocabularies. Trump insists the world is about to start getting cooler—“Just watch. I don’t think science knows, actually”—but according to every serious projection, he’s wrong. Carbon emissions will decrease this year because of the pandemic, but that just means the earth will heat up at a slightly slower pace—and all those wildfires are not only blasting forest carbon into the atmosphere now, they’re reducing the capacity of forests to store carbon in the future.  As if things weren’t hunky-dory enough in 2020, the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other unarmed African-Americans have sparked mass protests and counterprotests that have escalated America’s political culture wars into indelible moments of chaos, from the killing of protesters in Kenosha by a white suburban teenager to the tear-gassing of protesters in Washington so Trump could pose in front of a vandalized church to the riots and looting in Chicago. The whole mess has certainly raised some awareness about the routine injustices endured by people of color in America, and a lot of corporations have pledged to do better on the diversity front, but it’s still a mess.  Our political culture is also a mess, and Ginsburg’s death is making it even messier. Republicans who refused to consider Obama’s nominee for the Court because eight months before an election was too late have made it clear that two months before an election is not too late to rubber-stamp Trump’s nominee, because they have the power to do it. Democrats are warning that if they take power they might pack the Court, abolish the filibuster, add new states and otherwise rewrite the rules of Washington. It’s an all-out political war where both sides consider the other an existential threat to the nation. The rhetoric sounds a lot like actual war, with Trump talking openly about using the courts to shut down the counting of votes and using force to shut down any protests that might ensue.  Not great! #2020worstyear is a meme for a reason. For the same reason, Trump’s only consistent campaign message is that Biden would make things even worse. He sometimes argues for making America great again, again, but even after telling more than 20,000 falsehoods, he rarely tries to pretend that things are currently great. Instead, he’s retweeting deceptively edited and fake videos of Biden looking clueless and dancing to gangsta rap, while falsely claiming that Biden is a pedophile who wants to defund the police, destroy the suburbs, eliminate borders, confiscate your guns and quadruple your taxes.  It’s troubling that the president’s former national security adviser called him dangerously unfit, and perhaps even more troubling that the Justice Department is now investigating that adviser. Of course, John Bolton isn’t the only Trump aide turned Trump critic and Trump nasty-tweet-target; former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former fixer Michael Cohen wrote books, too, while former chief of staff John Kelly, who reportedly watched Trump call soldiers suckers, has backed Bolton’s claim that Trump pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden. Most recently, former homeland security adviser Miles Taylor accused Trump of offering preemptive pardons to border officials if they committed crimes, withholding disaster aid to blue states, and reshaping his Homeland Security Department into an arm of his reelection campaign. Trump has publicly trashed all of them, as if they were interlopers who infiltrated his administration.  This, to repeat the most overworked phrase of the Trump era, is not normal.  The normalization of banana republic-style abnormality was the main reason that last end-of-year essay was so gloomy. The economy was fine, but it seemed ominous that the president was attacking his own FBI, Justice Department and intelligence agencies for failing to trash his enemies; dismissing the investigation of Russian election meddling as a “WITCH HUNT” and cooperating witnesses as rats; calling prominent African Americans stupid and scapegoating immigrants as potential terrorists; and gaslighting the country so brazenly that The Washington Post’s fact-checkers invented the “Bottomless Pinocchio” to categorize his most egregious lies. It also seemed ominous that congressional Republicans had no problem with any of this, or with revelations that his for-profit university and charitable foundation were frauds, or with his administration’s routine defiance of congressional subpoenas. Meanwhile, Trump’s relatively normal advisers, the “adults in the room” like Mattis and Kelly, were leaving en masse.  Trump’s willingness to violate norms was a big part of his attraction in 2016. He seemed like an antidote to “politics as usual.” He told the establishment to go to hell. His base loved it, because he picked fights with the kind of people they hated. But some of the norms he constantly violates are the ones that helped make America great in the first place—not only norms of honesty and civility and decency, but norms of service.  Presidents have always at least pretended to try to serve all Americans, but Trump is quite openly the president of Red America, attacking Democratic cities and states as anarchic hellholes controlled by treasonous enemies of the people, withholding aid after disasters and threatening to send in troops during protests, most recently dismissing blue state coronavirus deaths as if they had happened in another country. No president has ever been so blatant about rescuing his political allies from legal trouble, or so open in his belief that his government should be tormenting his enemies. He has pardoned supporters like the right-wing propagandist Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing insurrectionist Ammon Bundy and the racist sheriff Joe Arpaio, while intervening to keep his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and political guru Roger Stone out of jail. And even after he was impeached for trying to gin up an investigation of Biden in Ukraine, he called for another one of Biden in China, his allies launched one of the Biden family in Congress, and his Justice Department launched one of the Obama administration’s national security team. When foreign leaders behaved that way in the past, the U.S. State Department used to issue stern rebukes.  Which brings us back to that 2020 electoral landscape. Trump is trailing badly in the polls, but he has not been doing the basic things one might expect of a beleaguered incumbent eager for reelection. He has not forced Republicans to give him more stimulus to help revive the moribund economy, even though voters tend to punish presidents for recessions that happen on their watch. He has not been moving heaven and earth to contain the virus—by ramping up testing or tracing, or begging Americans to wear masks, or at least not contradicting his public health bureaucracy in public—even though it’s obviously in his political interest to have the pandemic subside. And he has not made much effort to reach out to voters beyond his substantial but less-than-a-majority base of white MAGA voters; he’s still trying to kill Obamacare in court, he’s still complaining publicly about John McCain, and he didn’t even attend Rep. John Lewis’ funeral.  One possible explanation for this behavior, suggested recently by the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser, Vox’s Ezra Klein, and the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson is that the American public has become so irredeemably divided along partisan lines that there’s not much point trying to persuade voters of anything. Impeachment and the pandemic have not changed Trump’s bad-but-not-horrible approval ratings, and as Thompson pointed out, the implosion of the economy has not even changed the public’s views of the economy. In a shirts-and-skins nation where Trump can always count on a friendly echo chamber on Fox News and conservative radio and QAnon Facebook groups, it might be more politically effective to deny unpleasant realities that his base rarely hears about than to do the work to try to improve them.  The notion that the country is so polarized that nothing matters anymore is not a happy one, but it’s less creepy than the possibility that Trump isn’t trying to appeal to a broader range of voters because he has an alternative strategy for remaining in the White House. Beyond his message that Biden is a feeble dementia patient who can barely speak, and his secondary message that Biden is a fearsome leftist who’s going to rip America to shreds, Trump’s main themes about the election is that it’s sure to be rigged, that it’s impossible for him to lose if it isn’t rigged, that mail-in ballots will be riddled with fraud, and that his supporters should vote twice … just to stress-test the integrity of the electoral process. At the same time, a high-ranking Homeland Security official has alleged that Trump’s aides ordered him to stop seeking intelligence about Russian meddling in the election and start producing reports to back up a narrative about Chinese meddling. The Trump donor who runs the U.S. Postal Service has chosen the leadup to this unprecedented election during a pandemic to implement “reforms” that include removing mailboxes and sorting machines that could make voting by mail easier. Some of Trump’s media allies, including the irrepressible Stone, are basically urging Trump to declare martial law, and the president has been talking an awful lot about violence and strength.  It’s not an awesome situation. Even before Ginsburg’s death raised the possibility that a right-wing Court could block progressive legislation for a generation and roll back the regulatory state, Democrats were framing Trump’s reelection as the death of American democracy, while Republicans were portraying Democrats as forces sinister enough to justify any norm-breaking in the service of keeping them out of power. The longtime Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, whose new book, It Was All a Lie trashes the GOP as a kind of Mafia organization, believes this is the most dangerous moment for American democracy since the Civil War; he fears that Trump will send federal agents to seize ballot boxes in Democratic cities, and he doesn’t think anyone will stop him.  It’s certainly true that the Republican strategy for 2020 seems to rely less than one might expect on attracting new voters and more than one might hope on suppressing Democratic votes, helping Kanye West drain away Democratic votes, and messing with the mechanics of the ballot. My beloved Heat offered their downtown Miami arena as a roomy urban voting location; my Republican mayor, who’s running for Congress as a Trump ally, said no. The University of Georgia, which is opening its football stadium for football, refused to open its stadium for voting.  Whether or not the worst fears about the integrity of the election materialize, it seems quite likely that the post-election period will get ugly. No matter who wins, a lot of Americans won’t accept the results, and a lot of American cities might have Kenosha-type moments. This was a bitterly divided country even in 2014, when the first Awesome column ran, but it’s starting to feel more like two pissed-off countries living in two entirely different realities. It’s going to be really tough to govern. Meanwhile, China is on the rise, our allies feel abandoned and America’s total failure to control Covid has erased our global aura of competence and expertise. No matter who wins, it’s going to be equally tough to restore American leadership in the world.  Trump rose to power by warning about nonexistent “American carnage,” but now we have real American carnage. One enduring lesson of history, not particularly comforting right now, is that things can always get worse. But one enduring lesson of American history, the lesson of the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation and Bretton Woods and women’s suffrage and the polio vaccine and the civil rights movement and the iPhone, is that things can get better, too. America has the power to self-correct, to form a more awesome union.  Of course, there’s never really been a time in this country when everything was awesome; that was always a glib way of saying that for the decade after the anguish of the Great Recession, most things were getting better for most Americans, and that better is better than worse. But that era of improvement is over now, and so is the Everything Is Awesome franchise. Someday, hopefully, America will be made awesome again, again.'}\n",

Does the White House know?  It’s been three weeks since President Donald Trump made his last major public reference to California — when he addressed a rally in swing state Pennsylvania. “I see again the forest fires are starting,\" he said. “I said, ‘you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests.’ … Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.”  CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported Thursday that the president has been silent since that statement, which was “a familiar response [blaming] the state\\'s forest management.”  And a Climate Power 2020 analysis has tallied 46 appearances by Trump since an August 23 press conference, “when the president noted that he had approved a disaster declaration for California and spoken with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom,’’ Common Dreams noted Thursday.  Since then, the state has been slammed with dry lightning that lit hundreds of fires and a heat dome that has sent state residents cowering from broiling, record-high temperatures. The stress on electricity usage has mandated blackouts that have darkened communities of tens of thousands.  More than 3 million acres of the state have been scorched — an area twice the size of Delaware. And as the Sac Bee’s Michael McGough and Tony Bizjak reported, the lightning-sparked August Complex fire now ranks as the largest fire in the state’s recorded history.  Firefighters monitor the Bear Fire burning in Oroville, Calif., on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020. | AP Photo/Noah Berger  AND THERE’S THIS: With much of Northern California under the pall of an ungodly orange glow, “rarely have so many Californians been exposed to such gloomy, unhealthy air,” the LA Times’ Susanne Rust and Tony Barboza reported.  Trump has tweeted about everything from Kim Jong Un’s health to an endorsement Thursday for former CAGOP operative Jim Bognet, the ex-deputy campaign manager for Steve Poizner who’s now running for Congress in Pennsylvania. But the last time Trump tweeted about California’s health was August 6.  The deafening silence from the Oval Office hasn’t gone unnoticed.  “The West is on fire. Trump hasn’t bothered mentioning it,’’ read the headline of a piece by Gwynned Stuart in LA Magazine. Stuart noted that, “at the moment, President Donald Trump is attempting to manage the revelation that he intentionally downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed upward of 191,000 Americans. That effort has apparently left little room on his mental plate for the dozens of fires currently ravaging California, Oregon, and Washington.’’  Trump’s silence stands in stark contrast to other public figures, including his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden tweeted yesterday that “the images coming out of California, Oregon, Washington, and other Western states are truly horrifying.”  Trump’s 2016 Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton tweeted a nightmarish fire photo. “None of this is normal, and confronting climate change is on the ballot this year. Vote, as early as you can, for a habitable planet,” she wrote.  Former President Barack Obama also tweeted photos of California’s orange skies, saying “the fires along the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities. Protecting our planet is on the ballot. Vote like your life depends on it—because it does.”  Despite Trump’s silence, as AP’s Aamer Madhani, Kathleen Ronayne and Will Weissert note, climate change will shape the presidential election that’s now just two months away.  “The Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate change agenda could create problems for them in the Upper Midwest,” said Dan Schnur, who served as an adviser to former California Gov. Pete Wilson and Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. “Trump has shown no desire to talk about California beyond using it as a liberal punching bag to make his case to his conservative base.”  Stay tuned.  BUENOS DÍAS, good Friday. It’s the anniversary of 9/11. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s words at a press conference yesterday: “Never forget. Never forget. Never forget the tragedy it was, of course, to our nation, that blow, but never forget what it meant to each and every family to lose a loved one.”  QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I am actually done in San Francisco and closing my doors, unfortunately.’’ — San Francisco salon owner Erica Kious, who filmed Pelosi’s infamous unmasked blowout, said she’s closing her salon, reports SacBee’s Summer Lin.

That’s part of a troubling trend, and it comes on the heels of an analysis that found that only 4% of broadcast news wildfire coverage during the month of August mentioned climate change.”  LAPSE IN LEADERSHIP — ”California Assembly’s treatment of Buffy Wicks exposes Anthony Rendon’s dysfunction,” by the Sac Bee’s Gil Duran: “Rendon and his staff clearly didn’t work hard enough.

Gavin Newsom, after the president slammed California this weekend for its “extreme agenda”?  Trump will hit California Monday, touching down in Air Force One at McClellan Park to meet with federal emergency officials and local leaders about wildfires that have ravaged the state.  And while Newsom will join state fire and emergency officials in the Monday morning briefing with Trump, Newsom’s staff said Sunday night that meeting will be private, as Carla reported. The governor will then depart separately from the president for his own tour of active fire areas of the state, the governor\\'s team said Sunday.  The private session — and Newsom\\'s departure immediately afterward — follow weeks of silence from Trump about the devastating natural disasters in solidly blue California, as Carla detailed Friday.  And it comes on the heels of Trump placing blame on California last month for its wildfires, which have since consumed more than 3 million acres in the state and caused at least 22 deaths here. Newsom replied to the president in an address at the Democratic National Convention, rebuking Trump for saying “we hadn\\'t raked enough leaves.\"  The stop in California, which has been choking amid some of the world\\'s worst air quality for days, was added over the weekend to Trump’s already planned campaign swing to Arizona and Nevada, where he appeared Sunday.  President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally at Xtreme Manufacturing, Sunday, Sept. 13, 2020, in Henderson, Nev. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik  EVEN AS HE PREPARED TO COME HERE, Trump in Nevada this weekend slammed the state, telling a Minden, Nev. rally that \"California has already implemented this extreme agenda. And they\\'re experiencing massive blackouts.\" On the Western wildfires, he said repeatedly: “Please remember the words — very simple — forest management. Please remember. It’s about forest management.’’  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, on CNN with Jake Tapper Sunday, called Trump out: “There’s a deep feeling that you get different treatment in this administration, in terms of speed and attention, based on how people have voted.\"  Newsom on Friday expressed growing anger with those he said are continuing to downplay the effects of climate change — a description that clearly fits Trump. “California, folks, is America fast forward,’’ he said Friday. “What we’re experiencing right here is coming to communities all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.”  So Newsom on Monday clearly will not want to hand Trump a juicy photo op in front of Air Force One — something the president would no doubt use to his benefit in the next 50 days.  ONE THING’S FOR SURE: Look for the governor to avoid a repeat of the scenario when he praised Trump for his Covid-19 response — “promise made, promise kept” — only to find himself starring in Trump reelection campaign ads.  WAPO’s Philip Bump: “If California wanted Trump to worry about it, it should have been a swing state.’’  BUENOS DÍAS, good Monday morning.

She\\'s rated the No. 1 most liberal, and I would say if [Joe Biden] ever won, she would be president within the first month. Using him is just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they could destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in school.” — Trump at a Minden, Nev. rally on Saturday.  TWEET OF THE DAY: @GavinNewsom reacts to the shooting of two LA County Sheriff\\'s Deputies on Saturday night: “A 31 year-old mother and a 24 year-old are fighting for their lives because of this cowardly, horrific act.The perpetrator must be quickly brought to justice.

Here’s what we know,” by the LA Times’ Shelby Grad.

While climate scientists have been warning that compound disasters are an inevitable result of human-caused climate change, a spate of simultaneously burning, rapidly expanding fires spanning the entire West Coast was not expected for several more decades if greenhouse gas emissions remain high.”  — ”False Rumors That Activists Set Wildfires Exasperate Officials,” by NYT’s Kate Conger, Davey Alba and Mike Baker.  — Via POLITICO’s Debra Kahn: “California clears way for inmate firefighters to enter profession upon release”  — ”California’s wildfire smoke plumes are unlike anything previously seen,” by WaPo’s Matthew Cappucci.

When asked about the secret weapons system that Trump bragged about to Bob Woodward, O\\'Brien told Fox News on Wednesday: \"You can rest assured that we can protect the United States of America against any threat that\\'s out there because of the excellent manufacturing that we do here, the research and development that we do here and the fine servicemen and women who man those platforms.\"  The AP’s Robert Burns reported on Friday that Trump may have been referring to W76-2 warhead that is the \"business end of a Trident II D-5 missile carried aboard Navy ballistic missile submarines.\"  PRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — WILLIE BROWN RAISING MONEY FOR GOP GROUP: That was the scene in San Francisco over the weekend, as the former mayor and Assembly speaker combined forfes with businessman Ron Conway to raise $150,000 for Project Lincoln.

COMING FOR KAMALA — “Trump, struggling to define Biden, steps up Harris attacks,” by AP’s Kathleen Ronayne and Jonathan Lemire: “The racism and sexism underlying Trump’s critique of the first Black woman and person of Asian descent on a major party ticket are part of an aggressive strategy to appeal to white suburban voters.”  — ”President Nancy Pelosi? Don\\'t underestimate what she might do in office,” by The Hill’s Douglas MacKinnon: “Academic exercise or not, Republicans, conservatives and the Trump White House underestimate Pelosi at their own risk.

How is that fair?” by the SF Chronicle\\'s Heather Knight: “If ever there was a wake-up call that we’re in a climate emergency, this is it. All of us must act. Now. And yet in supposedly environmentally conscious San Francisco, we’re fighting over bike lanes and prohibiting through traffic on a tiny percentage of our streets.”  LAW ENFORCEMENT LAWSUIT — “Complex, years-long litigation anticipated in major LAPD protest lawsuit,” by the LA Times’ Kevin Rector: “The activist groups and individuals allege that the LAPD violated protesters’ constitutional rights by arresting them, at times on infractions that only warranted street citations, and then subjecting them to horrible conditions — including leaving them handcuffed on buses for more than 12 hours without access to bathrooms or water.”  ICYMI: “Cleaners Demand Harassment Safeguards From the Booking Service Handy,” by NYT’s Kellen Browning and Kate Conger: “The Public Rights Project, a civil rights nonprofit, is asking California to treat Handy’s workers as employees, which would force the company to step up protection for workers who faced sexual harassment.  “In a complaint filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Public Rights Project says nearly a dozen cleaners who worked on Handy said they had faced on-the-job harassment but could not get Handy to address it.

But it wasn’t a game-changer, either.  Sen. Kamala Harris of California went toe-to-toe with Vice President Mike Pence in a high-stakes debate last night — taking the Trump administration to task for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, taxes and jobs.  But the historic VP debate — between a black, South Asian woman and a white man — may be remembered more for the dodging and sidestepping of questions from both candidates.  Harris scored points early for effectively going after Trump and Pence on their Covid pandemic response — and may have come away with the toughest lines and hits on that topic, calling it “the greatest failure of a presidential administration in the history of our country.’’  Pence struggled to defend the administration’s Covid response — and completely sidestepped questions on America’s high infection rate and why the White House didn’t observe mandates on masks and social distancing at a recent event in the Rose Garden. His response: “President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interests of their health.” But he rebounded with hard parries, trying to pin Harris down on court-packing while arguing that she held radical positions on the “Green New Deal,” fracking and trade issues.  Vice President Mike Pence listens as Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris speaks during the vice presidential debate Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2020. | Justin Sullivan/Pool via AP  THE BOTTOM LINE: “Covid and Court take center stage at a more normal vice presidential debate,’’ by POLITICO’s David Siders: “Interested viewers could hear what the two candidates were saying. Disinterested viewers could flip the channel to baseball without worrying a bomb was about to go off.” More debate highlights via POLITICO.  CNN POST DEBATE POLL: Who won? 59 percent said Harris, 38 percent Pence.  CALIFORNIA-CENTRIC HIGHLIGHTS:  — Pence, asked about California wildfires and climate change, shouted-out Gov. Gavin Newsom: \"The climate is changing. The issue is, what is the cause, and what do we do about it? … With regard to wildfires, we believe forest management has to be front and center. Even Governor Newsom agrees that we need to have better forest management.”  — Harris’ comeback on wildfires: “Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. And so Joe believes, again, in science. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California, … you know what Donald Trump said? ‘Science doesn’t know.’”  — Pence criticized Harris for being too tough a prosecutor: “When you were D.A. in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were attorney general of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn\\'t lift a finger to pass the First Step Act on Capitol Hill. The reality is, your record speaks for itself.”  — A clearly annoyed Harris came back at him: “Having served as the attorney general of the state of California, the work I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. … This is the work that we\\'ve done, and the work we will do going forward. And I will not be lectured by the vice president on our record.”  LINE MOST LIKELY TO END UP ON A T-SHIRT, h/t NYT\\'s Jennifer Medina: “He interrupted me and I’d like to finish,’’ and “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking’’ — both tweeted all night by women who have experienced a “man-splaining” moment, including Assemblymembers Lorena Gonzalez and Buffy Wicks. A similar exchange, via BuzzFeed’s David Mack.  MEME OF THE NIGHT: The fly that landed on Pence’s head. The Biden campaign was ready with a visual joke, a fundraising pitch and Biden/Harris-branded fly swatters.  VIDEO OF THE NIGHT: A supercut of Harris’ facial reactions.  FROM THE TWITTERSPHERE:  — State Sen. @Scott_Wiener: “‘Donald Trump has Jewish grandchildren’ = ‘I have Black friends so I can’t be racist’”  — Trump campaign operative @RichardGrenell: “It’s clear that @KamalaHarris panicked whenever VP Pence talked about her record on Green New Deal, fracking, Criminal Justice Reform and how so many black people went to jail for minor offenses in California when she was AG.”  — Former California first lady @MariaShriver: “Thanks to both of these candidates for tonight. Thank goodness it was civil. Hope it doesn’t become all about the fly or the eye #VPDebate #VPDebate2020”  — San Francisco Supervisor @MattHaneySF: “Kaiser Hospital in Oakland just got a shout out in the Vice Presidential Debate! Yes!’’ (Also noted by SFGATE’s Amy Graff.)  BUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning.

It\\'s one of the most dangerous places in the country, both in terms of the assault that it makes on truth, as well as health.\" — Speaker Nancy Pelosi on “The View” Wednesday.  TWEET OF THE DAY: Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump’s message to a state where recent polls show he lags behind Joe Biden by 31 percent: “Vote TRUMP California. No more blackouts, shutdowns, ridiculous forrest fires, or water ‘rationing’ (coming soon). We can win in California NOW!”  WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced.

And interviews with dozens of homeless people, activists and local officials in 12 counties reveal a new magnitude of hardship and indignity for California’s homeless — and no easy answers ahead.”  GO A’s — “Oakland A’s keep season alive with thrilling comeback victory,” by the Mercury News’ Shayna Rubin.  AND ELSEWHERE IN BASEBALL — The Dodgers beat the Padres 6-5 Wednesday night, as the LA Times’ Jorge Castillo reports.  CORONAVIRUS UPDATES  NO OPENING AT ‘HAPPIEST PLACE’ — “California Gov.

THE TRUMP ERA  — “The White House is a coronavirus hot spot. But no one can make it do contact tracing,\" by the LA Times\\' Emily Baumgaertner: \"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends contact tracing for all coronavirus outbreaks, has teams of experts who could carry it out for the White House. The Trump administration, however, has relegated contact tracing to an internal team of doctors, who reportedly have focused on tracking down those in close proximity to the president between the Sept. 29 debate in Ohio and his positive test for the coronavirus two days later.\"  — “Trump officials blast California \\'sanctuary\\' laws in detailing arrests,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White: “Trump has regularly decried ‘sanctuary’ policies, singling out California as an example of Democratic lawlessness. His administration has unsuccessfully gone to court to try and dissolve California’s restrictions. Wednesday’s press conference helped bolster that message weeks before the presidential election, although Wolf insisted politics did not play a role.”  — “ICE arrests 128 immigrants in California ‘sanctuary cities,’” by the OC Register’s Roxana Kopetman.

It’ll take a ‘super, super, super-duper majority,’” by CalMatters’ Ben Christopher: “By default, a law enacted by ballot measure can only be changed by another law enacted by ballot measure. … Compared to that default, Prop. 22’s high bar for amendments actually gives the Legislature more influence than the norm.”  UNWANTED SUPPORT — “Darrell Issa’s uncomfortable endorsement by the American Independent Party,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Michael Smolens: “Some political strategists believe the AIP endorsement can help electorally in some areas, at least on the margins, or they wouldn’t pursue it for their candidates, who are frequently Republicans.

GAVINLAND  NEWSOM DEFENDS MASK TWEET — via POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci: “Newsom pushed back hard Wednesday against Republicans and conservative media slamming his recent tweet calling for masks in between restaurant bites, flipping it back on President Donald Trump by saying critics should ‘soberly take a look at what\\'s going on in the White House\\' and consider the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Americans and the economy.  — “Some Republicans have been having a field day with Newsom’s Oct 3 suggestion on Twitter: ‘Going out to eat with members of your household this weekend? Don\\'t forget to keep your mask on in between bites.’  — “The Daily Mail headlined [Tuesday] that Newsom is being ‘ridiculed’ for the tweet, and quoted from a number of critics who suggested the tweet was legislative overkill.  — “‘People want to bastardize these things and manipulate these health guidelines,’ said Newsom, asked about the criticism. But the Covid pandemic ‘requires seriousness of purpose and serious leadership — and it requires people to move out of their bunker mindset.’”    A message from The Great Courses Plus:  CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR  — “Can California ban fracking? Newsom\\'s bold plan to fight climate change faces skepticism,” by the LA Times’ Taryn Luna and Phil Willon: “The call to ban fracking left some questioning whether the intent of the well-timed move by a governor with a taste for big promises was to draw national headlines or to launch a political dogfight in Sacramento against oil interests and their trade union allies.”  EDD UPDATE — “Here’s how California’s new ID.me verification system for unemployment is working,” by the SF Chronicle’s Kathleen Pender: “About 64% of the people who applied for unemployment benefits in California since the Employment Development Department deployed a new online identification tool Thursday were able to verify their identities using a mobile phone or computer, the vast majority without human assistance, according to data released Wednesday.”  NO HOME FOR HOMEKEY — “Milpitas mayor threatens to sue California over homeless housing project,\" by the Mercury News\\' Marisa Kendall: Milpitas Mayor Rich Tran \"argues the project, which is exempt from the city’s usual permitting process, was rushed through without input from Milpitas officials or community members.\"  — “Newsom’s pick for California high court talks about coming out: ‘My journey was different’,” by the LA Times’ Maura Dolan: “He began coming out as gay during the last four to five years, he said during an interview Tuesday, and found the experience invigorating.

And as wildfires continue to scorch the state, and death tolls continue to grow, Trump hit McClellan Park, Calif. to meet with Gov. Gavin Newsom and state and federal officials in a two-hour stopover.  Trump, taking questions from local reporters, defended himself against critics who said he waited weeks to mention California fires, insisting he “immediately” responded to calls from Newsom. (He called our question about his delay on California response “nasty” — more on that later.) And the president also repeatedly insisted that the state’s troubles are rooted not in climate change but in forest management.  FIVE TRUMP VISIT TAKEAWAYS:  — TRUMP’S KEY MESSAGE: “I love California. I love all of our first responders and FEMA. We’ve been working very well with Gavin. We\\'ve been working very well with the state. We approved emergency declarations. And hopefully, it\\'ll be under control fairly soon.”  — ‘RAKE THE LEAVES’ REDUX? “When trees fall down, after a short period of time — about 18 months — they become very dry. They become, really, like a matchstick. And ... there’s no more water pouring through, and they become very, very — well, they just explode. They can explode.  “Also, leaves — when you have years of leaves, dried leaves, on the ground, it just sets it up. It’s really a fuel for a fire. So they have to do something about it. So we talk about forest management. And I’ve been talking about it for a long time — that they have to do that.”  — NEWSOM MEETING THE MOMENT: If some progressives wanted a Gavin vs. Donald smackdown, they didn’t get it. Newsom made his case — respectfully. “We can agree to disagree on the politics,” Newsom told Trump, “but one thing is fundamental: 57 percent of the land in this state is federal and 3 percent is state forests.” Read the full transcript of the meeting.  He later told reporters, according to pool report audio via the Chico Enterprise-Record: “I wanted the president to know that we have established an engagement we would like to build on — to state in a way that wasn’t trying to take a cheap shot, wasn’t trying to score political points, but to make the argument, we believe in climate change out here. We don’t believe it just because science says it; we observe it, we experience it, and that was an opportunity to remind him of a point he’s very familiar with, but to do so in an honest and forthright way.”  — CROWFOOT TOE-TO-TOE WITH TRUMP: The real drama came when California Secretary of Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot challenged Trump. His blunt argument to the president turned into the must-see moment of the day.  Crowfoot: “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it\\'s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians.”  Trump: “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”  Crowfoot: “I wish science agreed with you.”  Trump: “Well, I don’t think science knows, actually.”  — WAS THERE A PHOTO OP? Nope, no “shake hands and act like friends” moments between the governor and president that could end up in a campaign ad. POTUS seemed resigned to the optics of the day: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, I\\'d be OK with it. But maybe the state would rather not have that, and that\\'s OK with me, too.\"  President Donald Trump listens as California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a briefing at Sacramento McClellan Airport, in McClellan Park, Calif., Monday, Sept. 14, 2020. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik  THE COMING STORM — “Climate clash hits 2020 race as California burns,’’ by POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino, Caitlyn Oprysko and Carla: Trump and Biden “offered a striking split screen on the role of climate change in raging wildfires on the West Coast, with each staking out dramatically different positions on what has caused the blazes that have consumed vast amounts of acreage in California in recent weeks.  “In dueling events, Biden linked the blazes — as well as deadly heat waves and a recent string of hurricanes and disastrous flooding elsewhere — to climate change, while Trump dismissed the established science that shows global temperatures will continue to climb because of rising greenhouse gases from the use of fossil fuels.  AND THERE’S THIS, via POLITICO’s Colby Bermel: “Trump visit punctuates growing divide over main cause of historic wildfires in Western states” — “California seems helpless to break a cycle of catastrophic wildfires as it suffers another year of massive destruction, and the fault lines over climate change and forest management are growing as the fall campaign season gets underway.”  FACT-CHECK: “Trump downplays climate change, says California must thin forests. What he got wrong,” by the Sac Bee’s Dale Kasler.  BUENOS DÍAS, good Tuesday morning. Kamala Harris hits Fresno Tuesday for her first California event in months.

TOP TALKERS  ‘BLOOD ON MY HANDS’ — “A Whistleblower Says Facebook Ignored Global Political Manipulation,” by BuzzFeed’s Craig Silverman, Ryan Mac and Pranav Dixit: A leaked memo is “the story of Facebook abdicating responsibility for malign activities on its platform that could affect the political fate of nations outside the United States or Western Europe. It\\'s also the story of a junior employee wielding extraordinary moderation powers that affected millions of people without any real institutional support, and the personal torment that followed.”  WILL FEINSTEIN FALTER? — “Progressives fret Feinstein won’t be tough enough in handling Biden judicial nominees,” by the LA Times’ Jennifer Haberkorn: “Fueling progressives’ concern is [Sen. Dianne] Feinstein’s refusal to say whether she would give Republicans power to block appellate appointees through a Senate practice known as withholding blue slips.”  STUNNING ALLEGATIONS — “‘Like an Experimental Concentration Camp’: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges Mass Hysterectomies at ICE Detention Center,” by Law&Crime’s Jerry Lambe.  POLICE PLAY POLITICS — “How politics and police unions stopped bills to hold bad cops accountable,” by the LA Times’ George Skelton: “A major police reform bill was quietly killed by the Assembly speaker without a house vote on the last night of the legislative session. He used an ages-old tactic aimed at sparing politically vulnerable lawmakers from casting a perilous vote.”  CALIFORNIA ON FIRE  THE LATEST — ”More than 3.2 million acres have burned across California this year; death toll reaches at least 24,” by the LA Times’ Alex Wigglesworth, Taryn Luna and Phil Willon.  THE DEBATE — “Is climate change worsening California fires, or is it poor forest management? Both, experts say,” by SF Chronicle’s J.D. Morris: “Tree problems and a changing environment are not the only explanations for the fiery crisis, but they are an important part of the equation — and one that will continue to challenge the state in the months and years ahead.”  ADDING SNOW TO THE FIRE — “Extraordinary heat, rare summer snow brought unprecedented West Coast firestorms,” by the LA Times’ Rong-Gong Lin and Joseph Serna.  — “Because of fire, West Coast has four of the world’s 10 most polluted cities,” by LA Times’ Ruben Vives, Marisa Gerber and Molly Hennessy-Fiske.

THE TRUMP ERA  SENSELESS CENSUS — ”\\'Beyond negligent\\': Census workers describe logistical nightmare as deadline approaches,” by NBC’s Dartunorro Clark: “The agency announced last month that it would end all of its counting efforts on Sept. 30, a month earlier than previously expected. And although a federal judge recently ordered the bureau to temporarily stop following its plan to wind down operations early, a leaked internal Census Bureau document sent to the House Oversight Committee and obtained by NBC News this month warned that the agency already has far less time and fewer resources to review the data than in previous years.”  PRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT  HARRIS HISTORY — “Where Kamala Harris’ Political Imagination Was Formed,” by Slate’s Tessa Rissacher and Scott Saul: Rainbow Sign was “where she glimpsed a vision of Black empowerment, orchestrated by middle-class Black women with working-class roots—women who had broken professional barriers and were now trying to mentor a new generation of young Black people to find a vocation for themselves and transform the institutions they joined.”  CAMPAIGN MODE  PROP 22 ENDORSEMENT — “Editorial: Prop. 22 would stop the assault on gig firms and workers,” by the Mercury News and East Bay Times editorial boards.  AGAINST PROP 21 — ”Editorial: Vote no on Prop. 21, a rent control retread unimproved by age,” by the SF Chronicle Editorial Board: “While Prop. 21’s proponents point to the real threat of coronavirus-related evictions, the underlying problem is the economic downturn’s effect on tenants’ ability to pay their current rents — not the future rent increases that control policies are meant to restrict.”  POLITICO’S CALIFORNIA BALLOT TRACKER: No state does ballot initiatives quite like California, and interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to sway voters.

But he did have some ideas for what he might say to Mr. Trump, who was set to arrive on Monday to tour the fire damage, if he were still governor.”  CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR  POLICE BRUTALITY— “In Vallejo, police encounters often turn violent,” by SF Chronicle’s Otis R. Taylor Jr.: “Police stops that were initiated for minor infractions, or for unclear reasons, often turn into violent encounters in Vallejo, a Chronicle investigation found.”  — “LA Sheriff to politicians: emphasize trust in justice system,” by the AP’s Stefanie Dazio: Sheriff Alex Villanueva “claims the criminal justice system is biased against people of color, saying his department is committed to thorough investigations, including of its own employees.”  DAVIS DISPLACEMENT — “A $1.1 billion project will mean thousands of jobs in Sacramento. Will renters be displaced?” by the Sac Bee’s Theresa Clift: “In the two and a half years since UC Davis announced the Aggie Square “technology and innovation campus,” anxiety has been growing that it will displace longtime low- and middle-income families in the surrounding neighborhoods of Oak Park and Tahoe Park.”  DETENTION PRICE TAG — “‘Insane’: At up to $2 million per youth, skyrocketing costs at juvenile halls renew push for closures,” by the SF Chronicle’s Jill Tucker and Joaquin Palomino: “Based on the current population in juvenile hall, the annual cost to incarcerate a single youth could push past $2 million in San Francisco as staffing and spending remain mostly constant despite the dramatic decrease in young offenders.”  PROMISES BROKEN — “Some Bay Area homeless sweeps continue, despite coronavirus moratorium,” by the Mercury News’ Marisa Kendall.  A message from The Great Courses Plus:  SILICON VALLEYLAND  — “Oracle won the TikTok sweepstakes. It\\'s inheriting its political problems, too,” by POLITICO’s Cristiano Lima: “Oracle has spent years pushing to curtail the power of Silicon Valley’s social media giants. Now a pending deal with TikTok may force the cloud computing company to face the same tough critiques over how it protects users and polices content.”  — “SF had a $6 billion vision for Central SoMa. Then the pandemic hit, and tech pulled back,” by the SF Chronicle’s Roland Li and J.K. Dineen: “A delay or collapse in new construction jeopardizes not only the potential tax windfall, but also the city’s expected $2 billion in community benefits through 2040, funded mostly by fees that developers are set to pay in exchange for permission to build taller buildings.”  FACEBOOK TO REACH NET ZERO EMISSIONS THIS YEAR, via POLITICO Europe’s Laura Kayali: The tech giant announced its global operations will achieve net zero carbon emissions and run only on renewable energy this year. It also aims to reach net zero emissions for its value chain in 2030, including by using carbon removal technology. The company won\\'t use offsetting to reach this goal.

An affirmative action reinstatement (Proposition 16) and a “split roll” initiative to raise commercial property taxes (Prop 15) will go before voters in November. Both offer a chance to alter previous landmark voter-passed initiatives: Prop 16 would unravel Prop 209, the 1996 ban on race-based admissions and hiring for public institutions, while Prop 15 would relax the tax-limiting framework of Prop 13, the 1978 tax revolt measure that’s since become sacrosanct to big business and homeowners. But Prop 16 is in rough shape, and Prop 15 is in for a fight.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: A resurgent racial justice movement propelled affirmative action out of the Legislature and onto the ballot — but voters are going to be harder to convince than legislators. A new Public Policy Institute of California poll finds that Prop 16 is deeply underwater, with just 31 percent of likely voters saying they’d back it and 47 percent opposing it. There’s still a potential margin of victory in the 22 percent who said they had no opinion.  The cash advantage clearly rests with proponents: The ‘Yes on 16’ side has collected nearly $11 million, including from heavy hitters like Kaiser, the California Teachers Association and both legislative leaders, while the ‘No on 16’ side has generated about $180,000 – barely enough to buy some mailers, much less statewide TV time. But despite that monetary advantage, the numbers point to an uphill climb for proponents.  \"I Voted\" stickers distributed on Super Tuesday in El Segundo, Calif., March 3, 2020. | AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu  SPLIT ROLL: Progressives have long yearned to amend Prop 13 to generate more revenue, and a labor-backed coalition hoped high liberal turnout would make 2020 the year. PPIC found a slim one-point majority is now in favor of Prop 15, with 51 percent of likely voters saying they’d back it and 40 percent against it; that’s a decline from the 53 percent of voters who backed it in PPIC’s April tally, although the 11-point margin represents an increase of 5 points. And voters are invested in the outcome of this fight, with a vast majority calling the outcome important and nearly half dubbing it “very important.”  Campaigns still have six weeks to shape public opinion, and you can count on a dueling barrage of Prop 15 ads from well-funded supporters (who will say schools and cities need the money more than ever during a recession) and opponents (who will say an economic recovery is the worst time to burden businesses). Both are prepared to spend what it takes, although we may not see many first-term House Democrats backing the measure: Across eight competitive House districts, voters oppose Prop 15 by a two-to-one-margin, although PPIC includes the still-conservative CA-4 (12-point GOP edge) and CA-50 (10-point GOP edge) but not the recently flipped CA-49.  DATA POINTS: Gov. Gavin Newsom is sitting pretty with 60 percent approval from likely voters and 62 percent approval for his coronavirus handling. Those numbers put him in a commanding position as he navigates the politically treacherous balance between controlling the virus and reviving the state’s ailing economy, and Californian voters trust him far more than President Donald Trump, whose Covid-19 course they disapprove of by 35 points. But Californians are wary of what comes next: Voters are evenly split on whether we’re headed in the right or wrong direction.  And while Joe Biden is trouncing Trump statewide by 30 points, the president has a three-point edge (50 to 47) in those competitive CDs, where Republicans also drew a net lead of 12 points over Democrats (see caveats about districts above). And as Trump baselessly accuses California of voter fraud, Republican voters are wary of the vote’s integrity, with a third saying they have “very little” confidence.  BUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning.

TOP TALKERS  FOOTBALL FIGHT — “Newsom insists California is not Pac-12 roadblock,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White: “College football is big business and has become a major flashpoint in a national struggle over coronavirus restrictions. While Newsom did not actively call for games to commence, he also did not come out against athletes returning to the field. … Football players at the University of Southern California, a perennial juggernaut, had written Newsom lamenting excessive ‘restrictions imposed by state and local health officials in California that prevent us from resuming practices and competitions.’”  — “Sheriff’s combative response to shocking deputy attack sparks new alarms, criticism,” by the LA Times’ Alene Tchekmedyian: “Within 24 hours, a longtime Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman posted tweets about the attack that employed racist stereotypes in reference to a reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.”  BOAT FIRE — “A ‘pop,’ a ‘crackle,’ then ‘fire!’: NTSB records show dramatic moments as flames swept Conception dive boat,” by the LA Times’ Kim Christensen and Richard Winton.

Then Biden picked Harris.” by POLITICO’s Anita Kumar: “Within days, Harris was speaking to Indian Americans on India’s Independence Day about her grandfather, who helped push for India’s liberation.

Phi Murphy needed to finally get the millionaires tax done was a pandemic.  David Wildstein reports that Murphy, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Speaker Craig Coughlin are closing in on a deal coupling the millionaires tax with a one-time $500 tax break for some less-wealthy New Jerseyans, while putting the financial transaction tax off the table (at least as part of the budget talks).  This isn’t a surprise considering legislative leaders have been telegraphing their willingness since Murphy’s budget address, but it’s still shocking considering how dug in Sweeney had been against the tax since Murphy’s inauguration — the tax he passed numerous times under former Gov. Chris Christie, knowing it would get vetoed.  That was before Murphy’s popularity soared as the pandemic slammed New Jersey and hasn\\'t so far abated too much despite the tragedies at the nursing homes and the unemployment waits and the MVC lines. But I think the bigger factor here is not Murphy’s popularity, or the suffering of New Jersey’s less wealthy residents during the pandemic. The idea of continually resisting efforts to make the state’s wealthiest pay more when so many are hurting is politically untenable. And so the tax cut coupled with it makes political sense.  And don’t expect that baby bonds proposal to be in the budget.

Phil Murphy said Wednesday his chief counsel Matt Platkin will leave the administration in mid-October. Platkin will join the law firm Lowenstein Sandler in its white collar criminal defense and business litigation groups. Platkin has been in his role as chief counsel since Murphy took office in January 2018. Prior to that, he served as Murphy’s policy director during the gubernatorial campaign. \"For the past five years, Matt has been by my side counseling me on every single consequential decision I\\'ve made,\" Murphy said in a statement. \"From raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour to enacting the nation\\'s strongest equal pay legislation, Matt has served our Administration with integrity, talent, and a deep sense of purpose. I look forward to continuing to rely on his counsel as he begins the next chapter of his professional life.\"  LTCS — Murphy signs bills to raise long-term care wages and force reinvestment in resident care, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Five months after New Jersey‘s nursing homes and long-term care facilities were the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday signed four bills designed to help stem future outbreaks, stabilize the industry’s workforce and centralize the state’s unwieldy bureaucracy for oversight. “These are big steps forward to make sure we live [and] we learn — that we can address what was an uneven performance of that industry,” Murphy said during a Covid-19 press briefing earlier Wednesday afternoon, adding that there’s hope the legislation puts “some pieces in place that will have some permanent significance to allow us to weather future storms.” More than 7,000 residents and staff of New Jersey‘s long-term care facilities have died after testing positive for Covid-19, representing a little less than half the total deaths believed to have been caused by the virus since the state recorded its first case in early March.  — “Hundreds rally outside NJ veterans home to demand investigation of coronavirus deaths”  MAND MEN — Murphy won’t support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that he does not support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. POLITICO reported Wednesday morning that a bill to eliminate or reduce mandatory minimum sentences for mostly nonviolent drug and property crimes was quietly amended to also eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. An accompanying bill was also amended to make those changes retroactive for current inmates. As initially written, the bills, NJ A4369 (20R) and NJ A4370 (20R), were based on the recommendations of a November 2019 report by the New Jersey Criminal Sentencing and Disposition Commission. However, the report by the state-appointed commission did not recommend doing away with mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. “Let me say unequivocally, official misconduct was not on the list,” Murphy said in response to a question during his regular press briefing in Trenton. “So I just want to say as clearly as I can: I do not support official misconduct being roped into this legislation.”  THE INVINCIBLES — Positive Covid-19 tests rising among young people in New Jersey, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Young people are fueling the Covid-19 pandemic in New Jersey. The spot positivity rate for residents between the ages of 14 and 24 is more than triple that of the state at-large, Gov. Phil Murphy and Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli told reporters Wednesday. Residents in that demographic were testing positive roughly 3 percent of the time in mid-August, Persichilil said. That number is now eclipsing 7 percent, she said, citing the most recent data collected by the health department. Overall, the state’s spot positivity rate on tests taken Sept. 12 was just 2.06 percent. “With schools and colleges reopening, this is just a reminder to take this virus seriously,” Persichilli said during Murphy’s regular press briefing in Trenton.  — Opinion: “Illicit raid of Clean Communities Fund will gut litter clean-up programs”  — “Activists fight budget cuts to inmate transitional programs”  — “N.J. sales tax revenue rebounds for 1st time since pandemic hit.

Some say feds never asked,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Mike Davis: “At least $1.2 billion in loans from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program went to New Jersey businesses and other employers whose loan records show the funds weren\\'t used to save any jobs, an analysis by the Asbury Park Press and the USA Today Network Atlantic Group found. At least $165 million of those loans went to some 500 employers at the Shore, some of whom qualified for millions of dollars in bailout money to help them weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet employers and a major bank told the Network that the government didn\\'t ask them to provide information about the number of jobs being retained … The Network\\'s findings raise fresh doubts about the accuracy of the government\\'s accounting for the $659 billion loan program.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced legislation Wednesday that would appropriate $100 billion to advance the cleanup of legacy pollution and ensure safe drinking water across the country. The Environmental Justice Legacy Pollution Act — exclusively obtained by POLITICO — would also bar the approval of permits for major sources of air pollution, such as refineries or power plants, in communities already affected by it. “In order for communities of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities to thrive, this legacy of pollution must be eliminated,” Booker, the former mayor of Newark, said in a statement.  TRUMP LAWSUIT— Trump campaign seeks to halt early vote counting while lawsuit against New Jersey is decided, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: President Donald Trump’s campaign wants a federal judge to act soon to prevent New Jersey from counting mail-in ballots starting 10 days before the Nov. 3 election. In a court filing Wednesday, the campaign also asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael Shipp to bar elections officials from accepting mail-in ballots that do not have a postmark for two days after Election Day. The campaign and its co-plaintiffs, the Republican National Committee and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, filed an “an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue” — its first move to hasten the lawsuit they filed Aug. 18. But the motion, signed by state Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland), does not seek to immediately pause the larger plans for a mail-in election, despite the Trump campaign’s claims it violates the U.S. Constitution and three federal laws.  IMMIGRATION — “Court ruling could mean deportation of tens of thousands in New York, New Jersey,” by WNYC’s Matt Katz: “A federal court ruling Monday upholds the Trump Administration\\'s decision to eliminate Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan. The ruling could mean deportations of about 70,000 New Yorkers and New Jerseyans, including Nancie Adolphe, who arrived from Haiti more than two decades ago, at age 11. Adolphe has TPS, as do her parents. But her three siblings are U.S. citizens and would be left in Brooklyn if she and her parents lose TPS and get deported.”  — “Seven weeks before election day and U.S. Senate recount remains in court”  — “Presidential Politics has Huge Implications in CD2’s Van Drew v.

Council will vote Thursday on moving the capital city’s nonpartisan election from May to November. If passed, the measure, sponsored by controversial legislator Robin Vaughn, shifts the runoff for mayor and council races to December from June. The council passed legislation earlier this year that allowed Trentonians to determine by referendum whether to change the election date. Vaughn’s latest proposal, making it exclusively council’s decision, supplants the previous ordinance.”  GOING FOR BROQUE — “Ex-Roque allies including Rodas, Acosta, Vargas suing West New York for political retaliation,” by Hudson County View’s John Heinis: “Allies of former West New York Mayor Felix Roque including Steven Rodas, Silvio Acosta, and Ruben Vargas, are suing Mayor Gabriel Rodriguez and the town for political retaliation after being let go or demoted from their jobs last year. The 12-page, three-count lawsuit, filed in Hudson County Superior Court on September 1st, alleges that five former municipal employees had their civil rights violations — due to protected political speech — constructive discharge, and breach of implied contract.”  THE LEGAL ARC OF THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT — “Developer drops plans, at least for now, for sports betting parlor at former track,” by The Courier-Post’s Jim Walsh: “A developer has dropped plans for a sports-betting parlor at the site of a former Cherry Hill racetrack, according to a decision in a court fight over the proposal. Cherry Hill Towne Center cited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government restrictions in mothballing its project ‘at least for the foreseeable future,’ U.S. District Judge Renee Marie Bumb said in a ruling Thursday. The judge approved the developer\\'s request to drop its lawsuit against GS Park Racing, the track\\'s former operator. GSPR contends a restrictive covenant on the property gives it the exclusive right to offer gambling at the site. Cherry Hill Towne Center\\'s lawsuit sought a court ruling that the covenant was unenforceable.”  FLASHBACK TO 2018 — “Legislation Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law … to allow sports betting in New Jersey includes a provision for a sports book at the site of a former racetrack in Cherry Hill where there are no plans to ever host horse racing again.

The Italian American One Voice Coalition, a national organization ‘dedicated to the rightful representation of Italian Americans,’ said Mayor Robert Parisi’s decision to remove the monument in June deprives ‘Italian Americans of their civil right to honor their historic and cultural origins in the manner or manners they see fit,’ according to the lawsuit … The coalition is asking a federal judge to mandate the township to restore the monument to the intersection of Valley Street and Kingsley Street, where it had been since 1992 when the monument was dedicated by public officials to to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus\\' arrival to the New World.”  BLEED OF MUNICIPALITIES CONVENTION — “Paterson council members owed city hotel costs from 2018, 2019 Atlantic City conventions,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “Two City Council members and one former councilman owed Paterson about $2,100 for unpaid bills from the Borgata Hotel in Atlantic City from the 2018 and 2019 League of Municipalities conventions, according to public documents released Monday. Councilwoman Maritza Davila owed $857, or $371 from 2018 and $486 from 2019; Councilman Luis Velez owed $747, including $366 from 2018 and $381 from 2019; and former Councilman Shahin Khalique owed $486 from 2019. The city\\'s recent practice has been to pay up front for hotel reservations for elected officials and council members, who then are supposed to reimburse Paterson for the bills, officials said.”  TWEET OF THE DAY — @CouncilmanKurtz: \"We [Atlantic City Council] passed my resolution tonight calling on @GovMurphy to increase indoor dining capacity to at least 50%.

After months of keeping it shut down to stem the spread of the coronavirus — the only jurisdiction in the state, and one of a few in the country, to enforce such a ban — Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave city eateries the go-ahead to open their dining rooms on Sept. 30.  There will be rules, and lots of them. Restaurants are limited to 25 percent of their usual capacity, with tables placed at least six feet apart. Diners must have their temperatures checked at the door. Bar service is a no-go. Someone in every party must share contact information with the business in case there’s an outbreak and contact tracers need to track them down. And closing time is midnight.  Still, the announcement is a major step towards some semblance of normalcy for the one-time epicenter of the pandemic, and a boon for the devastated restaurant industry, which has been growing increasingly desperate as colder weather approaches. Indoor dining has been off the table since March, when bars and restaurants were forced to close as the pandemic bore down. Outdoor dining began in June , but plans to allow indoor service as part of the city’s phased reopening were called off as infections surged around the country, though restaurants in other parts of the state were allowed to operate indoors at half capacity. In recent weeks, frustrated restaurant owners hit the city and state with lawsuits and a growing number of politicians came out in favor of allowing it.  At the same time, public health officials and nervous New Yorkers will be watching carefully to see what happens to the city’s Covid-19 numbers when restaurants reopen — just over a week after schools welcome students back — looking to see whether the one-two punch headed into fall leads to new outbreaks. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was unsurprisingly not a part of Cuomo’s announcement, is mostly on board, saying earlier in the day that the city and state were working on a deal to allow restaurants to open. But he says that if the positive test rate hits 2 percent, the city will quickly reassess the decision.  IT’S THURSDAY. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ...

In a statement, a DOE spokesperson confirmed the two cases and said they notified staff at both schools immediately after the results were reported. ‘School staff have access to free, expedited testing and we’ve encouraged all staff to get tested before they return to buildings while we continue to navigate the realities of a pandemic,’ said Miranda Barbot of the DOE in an emailed statement... The city's Test and Trace Corps is also investigating the contacts the two teachers may have had. Under the DOE's protocol, one case does not close down a school, though staff had the option to work from home while contact tracing is complete.” Gothamist’s Sophia Chang  — “School buses will be rolling when New York City’s district schools reopen to students on Sept. 21, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised on Wednesday. His pledge came just days after education department officials told parents it was unclear whether transportation will be in place on time. About 100,000 school bus seats are expected to be available, covering students with disabilities who are legally entitled to bus service as well as thousands of other students who live farther away from their schools.” Chalkbeat’s Alex Zimmerman  — “A long-awaited return to school for some teachers was anything but a welcome sight. Educators at a building for children with severe disabilities walked into dirty conditions, missing protective gear, and incomplete ventilation checks, teachers and union officials said Tuesday.”  — Catholic schools across the five boroughs opened on Wednesday for in-person classes.  MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO drew widespread condemnation Wednesday for his decision to transfer hundreds of homeless men out of an Upper West Side hotel — a move opposed by his own social services commissioner, according to multiple sources. De Blasio said Wednesday he personally made the call to move nearly 300 men out of the Lucerne on 79th street, a luxury hotel in the affluent Manhattan neighborhood, following well-funded opposition ... De Blasio denied Wednesday he was caving to political pressure, insisting it was “the beginning of a larger effort to come back from those hotels” — a shift from just a month ago, when he suggested people experiencing homelessness could remain in hotels until there’s a Covid-19 vaccine. City Hall sources told POLITICO that Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks was not supportive of the decision — and shelter providers, homeless advocates and politicians said it only emboldens homeless shelter opponents around the five boroughs. POLITICO’s Janaki Chadha  — De Blasio said conditions around the Lucerne were “not acceptable” as authorities Wednesday morning discovered a resident had died inside.  — The number of people living in homeless shelters has fallen to its lowest level in six years, likely driven by a moratorium on evictions.  “CHRISTOPHER MCCORMACK is one of the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking officers. As an assistant chief, he helps oversee drug enforcement and organized crime investigations throughout the city. He was hand-picked for the promotion two years ago by his old friend James O’Neill, who was police commissioner. But his ascension started three decades earlier, when he was a rookie cop patrolling drug-infested Washington Heights. … He would earn the nickname 'Red Rage' for his ginger hair, fiery temperament and aggressive approach to policing. Street cop. Sergeant. Lieutenant. By 2006, McCormack was running his own narcotics squad. Captain. Deputy Inspector. By 2011, he had his own precinct, more than 200 officers in his command. ...  “Along the way, police leaders were privy to an ever-growing list of complaints against McCormack, signs that his harsh tactics and heated temperament were pushing the limits. Some of the grievances were made in lawsuits that the city eventually settled. Others were submitted to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, created to investigate misconduct. Many of the allegations were hidden from public view. Using court records, newly released data and a trove of confidential documents, ProPublica has pieced together just how much top officials had to look past to promote him. The allegations against McCormack read in some ways like those against many other cops in the NYPD: that he was destructive in searching a home or overly physical with someone on the street. What stands out, though, is how often Black and Latino men accused him of invasive, humiliating searches. They say he pulled down their pants in public, exposing their genitals; some said he used his fingers to search for drugs around and inside their anal cavities or directed his officers to do so.” ProPublica’s Joaquin Sapien, Topher Sanders and Nate Schweber  “TIFFANY Cabán, a former public defender who ran as an insurgent candidate and came within 60 votes of clinching the nomination for Queens District Attorney last year, is launching her campaign for the City Council on Thursday. Cabán, 33, is running to represent the City Council's 22nd District, which includes parts of Astoria, East Elmhurst, and Rikers Island in Queens. The seat is currently held by Council member Costa Constantinides, who will be term-limited out of office at the end of next year. The former public defender is expected to make the announcement in her home neighborhood of Astoria -- at the same location where she conceded the race against Melinda Katz last summer.” NY1’s Gloria Pazmino  “LAST WEEK, NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Burns retired from the department after a 36-year career. According to a video tweeted by NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, Chief Burns received a significant sendoff , including a large indoor gathering inside police headquarters that seemingly violated state health guidance prohibiting events with more than 50 people. Many in the crowd can be seen without masks on. Chief Burns's job was the commanding officer of the NYPD's Family Assistance Division, which helps the loved ones of officers who are ill or have died in the line of duty. More than 40 members of the NYPD have died from the coronavirus since the pandemic began, thousands more have called out sick with the illness... Seth Prins, an epidemiologist and professor at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, said the countless photos and videos of NYPD officers without masks on were ‘disturbing.’ ‘It's this kind of behavior that could lead to a second wave, or a second surge, of the virus,’ Prins told Gothamist.” Gothamist’s Christopher Robbins      WHAT ALBANY'S READING  “ROBERT FREEMAN, former director of the state Committee on Open Government, will pay a $15,000 fine to settle claims he broke state law by systematically sexually harassing women while on the job, including several reporters who sought his advice on public transparency disputes. The state Joint Commission on Public Ethics finalized a settlement agreement Wednesday with Freeman, a nationally renowned public-records expert who was abruptly fired from his state job in June 2019 after holding his post for more than 40 years. Freeman, 73, admitted his conduct toward women — as well as using his state-issued computer to view sexual images — violated state Public Officers Law, according to the settlement.” USA Today Network’s Jon Campbell  NEW YORK BUDGET WOES: SHOULD THE STATE FIX ITSELF?: De Rugy and New York University economics professor Nicholas Economides say rather than doling out more federal aid to state and local governments, leaders should identify where expenses can be reduced and productivity increased with fewer employees. ‘It seems to me like the governor has put all his hopes on the federal money, and getting money from the federal government, and that’s extremely dangerous,’ Economides said. ‘It’s possible to do the same job with fewer people. It’s possible to do technological changes that allow you to do things more efficiently, and that seriously needs to be taken into consideration.’” Times Union’s Amanda Fries  — “From taxing second homes to fees on yacht sales, several of the Capital Region's Democratic state lawmakers say all revenue-driving measures should be on the table as a means to fund public schools before they're bled dry…”  — The state teachers union is threatening to sue over Cuomo’s withholding 20 percent of its funding to local school districts.  “A FEDERAL judge dismissed a lawsuit Wednesday that sought to overturn Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s executive order halting evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lawsuit had been filed by a group of Westchester County landlords who said Cuomo violated their rights and deprived them of income. They said the order violated the Due Process Clause and the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. But U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel disagreed — and upheld an earlier court ruling. Further, the judge noted the landlords missed an August deadline for objecting to Cuomo’s request to dismiss the case. ‘The plaintiffs have not come forward despite an opportunity to do so with any argument or reason why the court ought not to grant the motions,’ Castel wrote. Therefore, ‘the clerk shall enter judgment for the defendants and close the case.’” Newsday’s Yancey Roy  #UpstateAmerica: Wow this sucks, kids.

TRUMP'S NEW YORK  “A TOP federal lawyer put forth a simple argument for why the Trump administration offered a false and misleading legal defense of its decision to bar New Yorkers from applying from federal Trusted Traveler programs. Senior officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection just didn't know any better, said Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Customs officials wrongly said in earlier court papers that New York, thanks to its Green Light Law allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses, was the only state that barred the agency from accessing driver's license records. In reality, several other states do the same thing — but ‘CBP was simply not aware of that,’ Strauss wrote in a letter filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan over the weekend. That being the case, it's wrong to presume that the Trump administration officials were lying, Strauss said.” The Buffalo News’ Jerry Zremski  AROUND NEW YORK  — Manhattan gynecologist Robert Hadden is facing federal criminal charges stemming from multiple allegations of sexual abuse against patients.  — Manhattan District Attorney candidate Diana Florence got the endorsement of the Teamsters, the ninth union to support her.  — A pair of protesters are facing federal charges for targeting Rochester cops during recent demonstrations following the death of Daniel Prude.  — New York City malls were allowed to reopen Wednesday, but Midtown’s Manhattan Mall was largely deserted .  — High school football, volleyball and competitive cheerleading won’t happen until March.  — New Yorkers are relying on word of mouth to find coronavirus test with fast results, and Councilmember Mark Levine is working on a bill that would require sites to publish turnaround times.  — The Greenwich Village Halloween parade is off .

Between February and July of this year, rents fell by 1.9% in the zip codes with the lowest COVID-19 rates in the city, like Battery Park City, Greenwich Village and Tribeca, according to the report, comprised of market-rate listing data.

MICHELLE WU IS RUNNING FOR MAYOR — Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu is officially running for mayor.  Wu is announcing her campaign in a video this morning. The at-large councilor known for her transit advocacy is pitching herself as a mother and the daughter of immigrants who has \"lived my whole life knowing what it\\'s like to feel unseen and unheard.\"  \"For too many, during this pandemic and well before, it\\'s been impossible to dream when you\\'re fighting to hold on. Fighting to afford to stay, fighting for our kids, fighting a system that wasn\\'t built for us, doesn\\'t speak our languages, doesn\\'t hear our voices,\" Wu says in the video .  \"I\\'m running for mayor to make Boston a city for everyone,\" Wu continues. She recorded the video in English, Spanish , and Mandarin . Wu lists priorities including affordable housing, public education, increased access to transportation, public health funding and a \"city Green New Deal.\"  Wu\\'s entrance into the 2021 mayoral race tees up the next big Democratic contest in Boston. She was the top vote-getter in the city’s last municipal election in 2019. It\\'s likely that Wu will face incumbent Mayor Marty Walsh, though he has not announced whether he\\'ll run for a third term. Pressed for an answer on his future plans last week, Walsh told GBH\\'s \"Boston Public Radio\" he has more to do in Boston.  \"I don\\'t have a plan to give up on a city where I have a lot more to do,\" Walsh said, but cautioned that he won\\'t reveal his plans for some time. It\\'s also unclear whether more candidates may jump into the race, and some political watchers speculate Walsh could score an administration role if Democratic nominee Joe Biden is elected in November.  \"The mayor\\'s race is a year away,\" Walsh said on Friday. \"I\\'m not gonna start playing politics in September of 2020 when I have much more important things to focus on.\"  Some accused Walsh of playing politics earlier this month when he confirmed to the Boston Globe that Wu had called him and shared her plans to run for mayor. Walsh pushes back on that assessment, saying the Globe had other sources and that it would have been unfair of him to withhold information from the press.  Wu will hold a series of campaign launch events throughout the week. She\\'ll begin by greeting MBTA riders at Nubian Station this evening and then visit supporters in Allston-Brighton. Wu begins the race with $346,000 in the bank, according to her latest campaign finance report. If he decides to run, Walsh has $5.5 million in his war chest.  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: BALLOT QUESTIONS READY FOR PRIME TIME — There are two questions facing Massachusetts voters in November: Whether the state should update a 2013 auto repair law, and whether it should implement ranked-choice voting in future elections. Groups linked to both questions are hitting the airwaves this week.  The Yes on 2 Campaign, which supports ranked-choice voting, is spending half a million dollars on its first ad blitz. The ranked-choice voting proposal would allow voters to rank all candidates on the ballot, rather than choose just one.  The group will spend $495,700 in the Boston media market over the next seven days, along with $54,500 on streaming services. The campaign will also spend $95,000 on digital ads. A recently-formed group that opposes ranked-choice voting has not bought space on the airwaves.  And the group opposing Question 1, the auto repair question, is out with a new ad this morning. The ballot question puts repair shops and automakers at odds, and has already drawn $35 million in contributions on either side of the issue. The question asks voters whether the state should update an existing law that would make it easier for independent auto repair shops to access vehicle data, though opponents of the question argue it would put consumer data at risk.  The new 30-second spot from the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data features Ron Santos, owner of Santos Auto Body in Millis. He pushes back on the pro-Question 1 argument that updating the law would benefit independent repair shops.  \"Question 1 is really about big repair chains getting access to your data, that can be sold to advertisers,\" he says in the ad. Top funders opposing Question 1 include General Motors, Ford and Toyota. Top-spending supporters of the ballot initiative include O\\'Reilly Auto Parts, Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone.

WHITE HOUSE EVENT HAS FAR REACH — The impact of a White House gathering where dozens of officials contracted Covid-19 has made its way to Massachusetts.  Legislative candidate Steven Xiarhos is quarantining after attending a ceremony for Gold Star families at the White House, the Cape Cod Times reported earlier this week. Xiarhos spoke at the Sept. 27 event and came into contact with President Donald Trump and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who have both tested positive for the virus. Xiarhos, a Republican running to replace state Rep. Randy Hunt, has tested negative for Covid-19, his campaign says.  And just over the border in New Hampshire, a Trump aide was spotted without a mask after being exposed to the virus. Corey Lewandowski, a Lowell native, was seen by a reader of his hometown paper at an outdoor youth sporting event in Pelham, N.H. A photo of Lewandowski sans mask was published by The Lowell Sun yesterday.  Lewandowski spent time with the president on the day that officials gathered to celebrate Trump\\'s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, and announced plans to isolate. The Trump adviser has said that his coronavirus test came back negative , but those who have been exposed are still recommended to quarantine for two weeks. New Hampshire does not have a mask mandate.  To be sure, there\\'s no evidence that what happened at the White House has led to a rise in cases in Massachusetts. But the fact that Xiarhos and Lewandowski were likely exposed to the virus and have returned to New England shows just how far-reaching an event where Covid-19 spreads can be.

Insults. Chaos. POLITICO\\'s Gabby Orr breaks down the key moments from Tuesday night\\'s showdown between Trump and Biden — and what it all means for the final stretch of the campaign.  In the fall of 2016, he shrewdly used the policy issues of immigration, trade and Obamacare, and the personal issues of alleged corruption, against Hillary Clinton. That formula yielded an Electoral College victory by taking three Midwestern states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — that had long voted for Democrats in presidential elections.  Those debate performances were always studded with Trumpian misinformation, gratuitous personal attacks and the strategic deployment of disrupting the proceedings. But Trump always had a core message and a well-honed argument about his opponents.  Tuesday was different for three reasons.  First, Trump, the king of powerfully simplistic political branding, no longer seems to have a message. In 2016 he had his four pillars of immigration, trade, Obamacare and corruption. He had slogans that were effective: “Make America Great Again,” “Build the Wall.” Quick, what’s Trump’s message in 2020? Nothing really leaps out. There is no Trump legislative agenda on Capitol Hill. He was asked recently by The New York Times what he wanted to do in a second term and the paper noted he talked about cutting regulations and taxes, appointing conservatives judges and border control. But the paper also somewhat mischievously recorded this meandering non-response from the president that became a popular meme:  “But so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we’d have a very, very solid, we would continue what we’re doing, we’d solidify what we’ve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done.”  The Trump campaign put out a second-term agenda, a hodgepodge of big ambitions (“Create 10 Million New Jobs in 10 Months,” \"Eradicate Covid-19\") and conservative buzzwords (“Teach American Exceptionalism”), but the president has been erratic in discussing the agenda or its key plank.  In 2016, Trump had a clear and concise line of attack against Hillary Clinton: She was a corrupt member of the Washington establishment and he was going to send her to jail if he became president. He discussed the alleged perfidy of her deleting personal emails with impressive discipline. But Biden has proven to be a more elusive target. Sometimes he is \"Sleepy Joe.\" Other times he\\'s a dangerous radical. At this point in the campaign in 2016, Clinton had become a despised figure among Trump’s hardcore supporters. Those supporters in 2020 can’t seem to muster the same amount of antipathy for the former vice president.  Finally, and most important, Trump in 2020 is burdened with a record, one that has sunk him into chronic unpopularity for several years now, even during the height of his economic boom. Trump was not the first American politician to successfully win an election by casting himself as a populist outsider taking on the corrupt establishment. That playbook is as old as the republic.  But those outsiders who suddenly arrive in Washington or a state capital with no experience and ill-equipped for the job suddenly realize the limits of the campaign schtick. (This happened to former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the former professional wrestler who declined to run for a second term in 2002.)  When they could be heard through the fog of Trump’s insults and interruptions, the portions of the debate that were most devastating to Trump were Biden’s prosecution of the case against the president’s handling of the pandemic, the economy and health care, particularly the effects of gutting Obamacare.  Biden was by no means commanding on Tuesday. In the hands of a more nimble and energetic Democrat, these portions of the debate might have been more devastating for Trump. (Naturally people on the left thought so: “Bernie would have annihilated Trump,” wrote the New York progressive activist Jonathan Tasini.)  What it all adds up to — no message, no killer line of attack against Biden, no defense of his record — is that Trump resorted to strapping on an explosive vest. Perhaps the idea was to sully both Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, who was incapable of controlling the president’s interruptions. “Mr. President, please stop,” Wallace said at one point, seeming to speak for many viewers.  If Wallace and Biden were discredited, then nobody had standing to fact check Trump or probe his record. Meanwhile, the stream of interruptions, personal insults and attacks on Biden’s family made it nearly impossible for Biden, who is already a mild-mannered debater, to make a clear case for himself or against Trump.  Whatever the thinking behind what the strategy would accomplish, it was born of desperation from a candidate who is mired in a health crisis he can’t control, down in the polls and struggling to articulate a case for why he deserves a second term.'}\n",

If Democrats figure that out, they win the state. But they have not.”  To break out, Biden has put more than $700,000 into a Florida ad highlighting Trump’s “planned cuts to Social Security.” The ad references an August executive order from Trump that would temporarily suspend the collection of payroll taxes, which fund Social Security. It’s Biden’s seventh senior-focused ad.  In a Tampa Bay Times op-ed, Biden wrote about “Donna and Roger” from The Villages, a retirement community north of Orlando, and how Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic left them unable to see their grandchildren.  “Jill and I feel the same way about not seeing our grandchildren as much as we want to,” Biden wrote. “Video calls are great, but they’re just not the same, especially after six months of being away from the ones you love the most at the time in your life you need them the most.”  Trump last week rolled out a package of health care-focused promises, including mailing $200 drug discount cards to retirees before Election Day to defray the cost of prescription drug co-pays, a push to end the practice of surprise medical billing, and a pledge to protect insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions.  And, like Biden, Trump also is tapping into fear. One campaign ad contemplates a lawless future if Biden becomes president. The 30-second spot concludes with “You won’t be safe in Biden’s America”. Trump’s campaign has so far put $1.1 million behind the ad in Florida, of which more than $400,000 was spent in the Orlando media market, home to The Villages.'}\n",

Trump’s campaign is hoping that more Mormons have gone the way of Lee and right-wing radio host Glenn Beck — erstwhile critics who’ve come to support Trump.  In 2016, Democrats did not appear to convert many of the Mormons who voted against Trump. Some stayed home, while many others cast a protest vote for the conservative LDS third-party candidate, Evan McMullin, who earned 21 percent of Utah’s vote. McMullin also received about 7 percent in neighboring Idaho, but his support in Arizona was negligible because he was not listed on the ballot and was only a write-in candidate.  Without McMullin in the race, and with turnout expected to exceed that of 2016, both parties see a rare group of potentially persuadable voters at a very unpersuadable time.  “Not having the third party ticket with Evan McMullin will help give us an opportunity to pull some of those voters into the Trump camp,” McDaniel, who is Romney’s niece, said.  McMullin, who still opposes Trump, said he thinks some of his supporters will vote for the president but that “most people who voted third party in 2016 will be supporting Biden in this election.” He argued that some Republicans voted for Trump “out of habit” but have since soured on him.  A Biden official conceded that Trump will likely improve on his 2016 performance among Mormons, but that the Democrat\\'s goal is to significantly limit those gains. Some longtime LDS Democratic organizers said Biden has already improved on Hillary Clinton’s efforts, which they said were too focused on Utah.  “The Biden campaign seems much more aware of the Latter-day Saint diaspora in the Mountain West and the Atlantic South,” said Rob Taber, a national co-chair of LDS Dems.  \"It’s not going to be shocking that Trump wins the Mormon vote, but if it’s 10 to 15 points off of the norm in Nevada and Arizona, that’s a big deal,\" said Quin Monson, a partner at the Utah-based polling firm Y2 Analytics and a political science professor at the Church-funded Brigham Young University. \"It’s the equivalent of Republicans suddenly getting a quarter of the African American vote, and I do think it’s within the realm of possibility. They\\'ve not come around completely on Donald Trump.\"  So far, the Trump campaign appears to be dedicating more of their candidates’ time to courting Mormon voters. While Pence visited Arizona, there are no plans for Biden or his running mate Kamala Harris to participate in a Mormon-oriented event. Biden’s advisers believe his Roman Catholicism could also appeal to LDS voters, but the campaign isn’t airing ads in Arizona focusing on his religion.  Trump is trailing Biden by about 5 points in Arizona, according to polling averages, and LDS voters could be decisive if the race tightens. In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema won massive Maricopa County — which includes the historically Mormon suburb of Mesa — becoming the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate seat since the 1980s.  Trump\\'s campaign advisers have said they don\\'t see Maricopa County as a must-win; instead, they’re looking to run up the president’s margins in rural Arizona. The LDS enclaves in the White Mountains will be key to that effort.'}\n",

The tactic is now familiar for Trump: Throw out a bunch of policy offerings — real or not — in the run-up to an election in the hopes something will stick. In 2018, he promised a tax cut proposal that never materialized and turned a “caravan” of migrants into a scare tactic that he dropped shortly after the election. Now, it\\'s a series of executive orders, signing ceremonies and Twitter proclamations that are often oversold or appear micro-targeted to specific voting blocs.  “There’s a concerted effort to make good on promises from the 2016 campaign trail, as well as promises that have been made during President Trump’s first term in office,” said Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller. “Many of these things we have coming up have taken years to put together or move along, so this just happens to be when things are brought to completion.”  Critics say the rapidity of announcements and the campaign’s eagerness to spin them into ads demonstrates the underlying political motivation.  After Tuesday’s signing ceremony at the White House, Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America said “any opening between Israel and its neighbors is a positive thing,” but added, “there’s no denying this ceremony was driven by domestic politics for Donald Trump.”  But Ralph Reed, a top surrogate for the Trump campaign and the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a major social conservative group, hailed the event as historic.  “The fact that it plays well with some constituencies in no way diminishes the historic nature of the achievement or its potential to advance peace in the region,” said Reed.  There’s nothing new about incumbent presidents fast-tracking policies or announcing diplomatic breakthroughs in the lead-up to an election. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed bipartisan welfare reform into law, taking the policy issue off the table for Republicans. And in 1964, President Lyndon Johnson, hoping to push back on criticism about his foreign policy credentials, signed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which enabled Johnson’s use of military force in Vietnam, and the Wilderness Act to help bolster his standing with conservationists.  “Within a matter of weeks in 1964, you saw Johnson addressing two weak spots, conservationists and the Roosevelt Republican world and foreign policy,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “It’s an advantage that a sitting president has that they can create a dramatic backdrop for whatever they do.”  POLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Trump brought the presidential backdrop to Florida last week, where he made a show of signing a moratorium on oil drilling off the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The move gained kudos from Republicans in the tourism and real estate industries concerned about the potential impact offshore drilling could have on their businesses.  Yet Trump was essentially reversing his own initiatives with the move: He vowed in 2018 to allow oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, and just last month finalized plans to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas development. Trump has also rolled back Obama-era regulations on fossil fuels and exited the Paris agreement on climate control measures, two moves that environmental advocates say will damage the climate and increase pollution.  Gina McCarthy, head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama and now CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move was a “transparent attempt to manipulate Floridians two months before Election Day.”  Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said, \"What families aren’t hearing from Donald Trump at these events is deafening: a coherent strategy to lift the country out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and change the game for middle-class families.”  Officials say similar announcements are expected in the coming weeks, although some might remain promises that never come to fruition.  The president will also continue his rallies at airport hangars, where Air Force One is always on display, interspersed with official events at the White House that regularly include political attacks on Biden.  Those events may focus on trying to show action on the Trump campaign promises that remain unfilled. Obamacare remains intact, Trump’s congressional proposal to overhaul immigration laws has not moved and numerous “Infrastructure Weeks” never produced a substantial bill. Several long-touted policy rollouts, like Trump’s Obamacare replacement proposal, have similarly blown through months of self-proclaimed deadlines.  “Every September and October before the election you’re trying to do two things,” said Brinkley. “Develop dirt on their opponent and showcase your presidency.”'}\n",

Microsoft\\'s bid, which included retail giant Walmart, would have purchased TikTok\\'s U.S. operations as a way of resolving the administration\\'s concerns about the popular video sharing app\\'s possible ties to the Chinese government.  \"ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,\" the company said Sunday evening.  American interest in TikTok increased when the Trump administration signaled in early August that it was considering banning the app amid worries that U.S. data is being funneled to the Chinese government. Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 6 that would prohibit TikTok from conducting transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20.  Beijing has since put in place regulations requiring the government to sign off on the sale of valuable technology, including algorithms like those that power TikTok. That means any transaction would need to win the approval of officials in China and the U.S., a challenging proposition as Chinese leaders have criticized Trump\\'s effort to force a sale of the company.  Trump\\'s executive order declared TikTok a national security threat due to its alleged ties to the Chinese government and barred the company from transactions in the U.S. starting Sept. 20. A follow-up executive order gave TikTok\\'s Chinese parent company ByteDance 90 days to sell its U.S. business — a deal that would require Trump\\'s approval.  In late August, China’s Ministry of Commerce added artificial intelligence technologies to an export controls list, casting doubt about whether the government must green light the sale of TikTok to a foreign company. ByteDance said it would \"strictly comply\" with the new Chinese rules.  The president\\'s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told POLITICO on Aug. 27 that the administration had no preference for a TikTok buyer, so long as data from U.S. users doesn\\'t flow to Beijing. Trump himself also appeared flexible so long as the Treasury Department is \"well compensated\" in the deal.  \"I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people, but they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we’re the ones making it possible,\" the president told reporters at an event in Yuma, Ariz., in mid-August.  Trump did lend a boost to Oracle\\'s bid at the time, calling it a \"great company\" that \"would be certainly somebody that could handle it.\" Oracle\\'s Chair Larry Ellison hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February and Oracle executives have been close advisers to his administration even when other tech giants shied away.  Microsoft has cultivated its own positive relationship with the Trump administration, despite high-profile disagreements over issues like immigration and the environment. CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump directly in the days before he issued the TikTok executive order, helping to convince the president a sale would be better than an outright ban.  Other companies reportedly interested in the app included Google\\'s parent Alphabet, Twitter and the Japanese multinational SoftBank, although preliminary negotiations with those firms fell flat.  TikTok has become a social media phenomenon that has only grown in popularity during coronavirus self isolation. The company recently said it counts 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. who generate a trove of lucrative personal data on the internet habits of, mostly young, consumers.

He attributed the change to Trump’s management of Covid-19, calling it “the greatest mistake of his presidency.”  “It’s going to be close among my members between Biden and President Trump, but there’s been dramatic change in the last six months,” McGarvey said, adding that if Trump had been more aggressive toward the coronavirus, “He’d be bulletproof. We wouldn’t even be talking about Joe Biden now.”  However, even as they praise the Democratic presidential nominee as a less-flawed candidate than Clinton, other union leaders said they fear there’s nothing they can say to the Trump supporters among their ranks to sway their opinion between now and November.  They said parts of Biden’s record, such as his past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, hurt him, and that some members still look to the pre-pandemic economy under Trump as a high point.  “It doesn’t seem like there’s anybody changing their minds,” said Don Furko, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1557 in Clairton, Pennsylvania, who said the majority of his membership is backing Trump.  In northern Minnesota, local USW officials are working to educate members on steps Trump has taken to attack organized labor and encouraging them to vote for their jobs rather than on social issues like immigration, said John Arbogast, staff representative for District 11. But, he added, “you’re not going to change a Trumpster’s opinion.”  TJ Ducklo, Biden’s national press secretary, said the former vice president “sees this election as Park Avenue vs. Scranton — a choice between someone who has always stood up for working people and believes this country was built by unions, and Donald Trump, who punishes the middle class with tax cuts that only benefit him and his rich friends.”  Samantha Zager, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said, “Throughout his 50 years in politics, Biden has consistently put special interests ahead of American workers — including in his promise to shut the economy back down if he were elected — and that’s why President Trump is seeing strong support from union members.”  At a national level, most union officials have largely lined up behind Biden, appearing with him at events and acting as campaign surrogates. But they said their efforts to spread that enthusiasm have been hindered by the pandemic, which has severely limited organized labor’s in-person ground game.  With the exception of Unite Here, most unions have avoided door-knocking in an effort to prevent spreading the virus. Labor officials said some members don’t share their cell phone numbers, which is a challenge when their efforts to boost Biden have shifted to phone-banking, texting and other virtual work. So-called labor walks — organized labor’s term of art for canvassing — are largely no more.  Pat Eiding, president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, said trades leaders need to talk with their members more often about Biden to be effective. A refinery closed recently in the city and Trump supporters have misleadingly made some union workers believe he'll bring back the facilities, he said.  The evidence that member outreach works, he said, is the 2008 presidential election, when they spoke frequently with the rank-and-file at job sites as early as 5 a.m. and overcame prejudice in their unions against an African-American Democratic nominee.  “We said ... the man’s Black. But here's the issues: He’ll protect you and your jobs,’” he said. “And when we were able to go directly to members, instead of just being on a bully pulpit, we were able to get them to vote for Obama. And that was not an easy thing to do.”\"}\n",

In his blatant play to win over conservatives who may have been alienated throughout his first term in office, Trump asserted Democrats are at the forefront of an “extreme movement” that, if “granted a majority on the Supreme Court, will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress.”  The “radical justices” appointed by a hypothetical Biden administration, Trump claimed, would “erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion.” They would also, he asserted, “give unelected bureaucrats the power to destroy millions of jobs” and “remove the words ‘under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance” — despite Biden’s never having proposed any of those things.  The rest of Trump’s list includes Bridget Bade, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron; Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general; Stuart Kyle Duncan, a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice; Noel Francisco, a former solicitor general; James Ho, a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Gregory Katsas, a judge on the D.C.

Cruz (R-Texas), Hawley (R-Mo.) and Cotton (R-Ark.), all of whom were vocal critics of Trump‘s high-profile Supreme Court losses this summer, join one other hardline conservative, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, on Trump’s most recent list.  But while Cruz and Cotton quickly issued statements thanking Trump for the honor of being named to the not-so-shortlist, Hawley said that he had declined the offer from the president and White House multiple times.  \"He first broached this with me, it\\'s been, oh, some weeks ago now,” Hawley told POLITICO. “Well, we were talking about something and the Supreme Court came up … and he said, ‘Oh Josh I\\'d like to put you on the list.’ And I said, ‘Oh no, I\\'m not interested,’ and I had that same conversation with the White House counsel separately, and then separately with the chief of staff. And the president called me again today and he said I\\'d really like to put your name on the list, and I said I\\'m very honored by your confidence but I\\'m not interested.“  The senator said that he had a heads-up that his name would appear on the list anyway, but that he looked forward to continuing to serve in the Senate.  Trump announced his intention to release a refreshed list over the summer, after the Supreme Court dealt him a series of legal blows on cases pertaining to issues that have historically fired up his base of conservative evangelicals, like abortion, LGBTQ protections and immigration.  But its release comes as the president enters the final two-month stretch of his reelection campaign very much the underdog — though within striking distance — of former Vice President Joe Biden.  The potential nominees unveiled on Wednesday make up the fourth iteration of Trump’s vaunted list, first released in May 2016 when he was only the presumptive Republican nominee, in an unprecedented effort to shore up conservative support. Trump added another 10 names to the original list of 11 in September of that year, an addition that included Neil Gorsuch, who was Trump’s first appointment to the Supreme Court days after he assumed the presidency.  In November 2017, Trump added another five names to the list, from which the White House said he would select all future Supreme Court nominees.  Trump’s efforts to remake the federal judiciary have been a keystone — if a relatively under-the-radar one — of his presidency, and he frequently touts the hundreds of federal judges appointed and confirmed during his tenure, even if he often inflates the total number, as he did again on Wednesday.  But without a vacancy on the high court as there was in 2016, the Supreme Court has been a backburner issue throughout the 2020 campaign, despite several health scares this year alone from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 87 and in fragile health, and has become a liberal icon on the court.  The issue picked up new urgency for Trump this summer, however, after a string of high-profile losses in spite of a 5-4 conservative majority on the bench. In one key decision blocking Trump\\'s decision to end the DACA program, Chief Justice John Roberts, an appointee of President George W. Bush, served as the decisive swing vote. In another potentially momentous case, Gorsuch penned the majority opinion as the court found that employment discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgender people is barred by existing law, despite several decades of political and legal consensus that it was not.  \"I did a lot of panels at the end of the Supreme Court\\'s term and I was amazed at how angry a lot of conservatives were,\" said Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice, which advocates for conservative judicial nominees. \"I don’t think there\\'s any doubt that conservative disappointment with this last Supreme Court term has affected what conservatives are looking for in a nominee ... There\\'s a lot of movement conservatives out there who need reassuring.\"  Trump seemed to both stoke those worries and try to capitalize on them as he vividly attacked the “politically charged” rulings, describing them as “shotgun blasts into the face” of conservatives. He vowed to issue his latest list by Sept. 1, although he wound up missing that self-imposed deadline by about a week.  In another tweet, he sought to clearly lay out the stakes for his voters come November. “Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religious Liberty, etc.),” he wrote.  The pledge divided Trump’s advisers , who split over the summer about whether the president should tighten the vetting process and winnow his list or expand it further.  Trump’s decision to nearly double his existing pool of choices could upset those who favored slashing the original list by as much as half, arguing for a more stringent vetting process, as well as the removal of those with limited records from which to judge the consistency of their judicial philosophy. Those in favor of expanding the list argued that Gorsuch departed from such consistency in his ruling this summer.  “The whole purpose of the list is to give hard-line conservatives a guarantee that we will not be betrayed again,” one Republican close to the White House told POLITICO in July.'}\n",

Seeking to draw a contrast with Biden, Trump said the Democratic nominee would open the doors for refugees from \"jihadist regions\" like Yemen and Somalia. He also derided Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who came to the United States as a child refugee from Somalia, calling her an \"extremist.\"  Trump last year called for Omar and a number of other high-profile progressive congresswomen to \"go back\" to \"the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Supporters also chanted \"send her back\" during a Trump rally last year — a line that has become a rallying cry among his base.  \"Omar, how the hell did she win the election,\" Trump said Friday.  Trump also directly echoed his law-and-order message in the town a couple of hours to the north of Minneapolis, which was a nexus of protests early this summer after George Floyd was killed by a white police officer. Trump has since derided the protests as violent uprisings, urging federal forces to restore order.  \"They\\'re still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis?\" Trump said to a jeering crowd. \"See they never learn.\"  Trump has rebranded his rallies as \"peaceful protests\", mocking municipalities that have allowed protesters to gather in spite of social distancing requirements and crowd-size limits due to the coronavirus pandemic. During his Friday talk, attendees were closely packed together, many not wearing masks.  Conspicuously absent from his address was any mention of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death was announced during his rally. Trump bragged during the speech that he didn\\'t look at the teleprompter when speaking at rallies, and no aides interrupted him on stage.  Just before boarding Air Force One after his rally, Trump said: \"She just died? I didn\\'t know that. She led an amazing life, what else can you say?\"  Recent polling has shown Biden pulling ahead in Minnesota, but Trump said Friday that what he\\'s read about the area made him confident he was in good standing.  \"There\\'s no way that I\\'m nine points down,\" Trump said. \"This is not the crowd of somebody\\'s who\\'s going to finish second in this state to sleepy Joe.\"  Trump’s appearance comes on the heels of Biden\\'s own trip to the battleground state. The former vice president toured a training center in a suburb of Duluth and uncorked a speech aimed at union members and blue-collar workers in the state.  “Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my life with guys like Donald Trump looking down on me; looking down on people who make a living with their hands, people who take care of our kids [or] clean our streets,” Biden said. “These are the guys who always thought they were better than me, better than us, because they had a lot of money.”  Biden also picked up on the “Scranton vs. Park Avenue” theme his campaign has raised in recent days, including at a televised town hall Thursday near the former vice president’s birthplace in Pennsylvania. Biden again tore into comments Trump made earlier this week to journalist George Stephanopoulos that “stocks are owned by everybody” as part of a defense of his stewardship of the economy during the pandemic.  “What the hell’s he talking about?” Biden said. “People I grew up with in Scranton, Claymont, [Del.], they don’t have money in stocks. Every penny we made was to pay the bills and take care of the families, put clothes on the back and a roof overhead.”  Shortly before taking the lectern at his Bemidji rally, Trump mocked Biden\\'s \"Scranton vs. Park Avenue\" line, repeating his common attack as Biden an internationalist who will bend to China\\'s will.  \"Joe Biden says this is a race between Scranton and Park Avenue,\" Trump tweeted. \"This is a race between Scranton and China. Joe Biden betrayed Scranton, and America, to China and foreign countries. I will always put America First!\"  Nick Niedzwiadek contributed to this report.'}\n",

By contrast, Judge Morgan Christen, an Obama appointee, suggested there was enough flexibility for the authorities in the order that the appeals court should allow the injunction to go back into effect.  The third jurist on the panel, Clinton-appointed Judge Johnnie Rawlinson, seemed like she could be the swing vote. Her take on the injunction was harder to assess, but she said the case involved the challenge of balancing the rights of journalists “against the right of the police to maintain order.”  “How are we supposed to make that balance?” Rawlinson asked.  The injunction and earlier TRO Simon issued bars federal agents from using force against journalists or legal observers and exempts them when orders are given to the general public to disperse. Officers remain free to arrest people who claim to be press or observers, but who engage in criminal activity.  Justice Department lawyer Sopan Joshi told the court that the injunction puts federal agents in danger and complicates their work.  “This injunction is currently hanging over their heads and every interaction comes with an untenable choice, which is they have to risk their safety or risk contempt,” he said.  Joshi also said officers face danger from individuals who claim to be press in order to get behind police lines.  “The whole point of a dispersal order is to clear the area of everybody,” Joshi said. “The unrebutted facts show that there are violent opportunists that are hiding behind and pretending to be press.” The DOJ lawyer also asked what officers are to do if “everybody in the crowd pipes up and says, ‘I’m a journalist.’”  Matthew Borden, an attorney who brought the case in cooperation with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the concerns about troublemakers masquerading as journalists are exaggerated and that the judge’s orders have proven workable. “There is a perfect track record of safety under this injunction,” he said.  Borden said the injunction is crucial to guarantee an independent perspective on the disturbances in Portland and the efforts to quell them. “Allowing the government to control the news is the hallmark of a dictatorship ... They have a public affairs agent who is there taking video and taking photographs,” he said. “Somebody needs to be there to document whether these dispersal orders are legal and whether they’re being enforced in a proper and constitutional way.”  Joshi argued that the injunction privileges journalists by guaranteeing them “special access” in a way the Supreme Court has never countenanced.  O'Scannlain seemed to agree with that assessment, but Borden insisted that was not the case. He said that while federal agents might be infringing on the rights of many members of the public, including protesters and other passers-by, journalists had the right to go to court and seek protection for themselves even if the injunction Simon granted is “underinclusive.”  Borden also said that given the series of allegations that some federal agents directly targeted journalists with less-than-lethal munitions, an order giving media representatives some added protection was appropriate. “Maybe it’s a broader protection than what they might otherwise be entitled to, but it is a reasonable exercise of equitable powers,” he said.  Christen said there were “lots and lots of examples” in the court record of journalists claiming they were injured by federal officers. And she emphatically noted that many courts have joined the 9th Circuit in finding a constitutional right to videotape police.  “That right has been explicitly recognized by the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 11th Circuits. We’re not alone in that regard,” the judge said.  Christen also noted that the injunction permits incidental use of force against journalists if they happen to be intermingled with others legitimately targeted by authorities. And she also questioned whether the federal agents have authority to issue dispersal orders off of federal property.  Joshi said that power exists at the federal courthouse and in a park nearby, but the full scope of that authority isn’t relevant to the current case.  One issue that came up near the outset of the 40-minute argument, which the judges and Borden joined by videoconference and Joshi joined by phone, was just where the federal agents are now.  The Trump administration dispatched dozens of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to Portland in early July after declaring that local officials were being ineffectual in preventing damage to the federal courthouse and other federal buildings. The deployment was opposed by Portland’s mayor and seemed to amplify the protests.  Several weeks later, the Trump administration and Gov. Kate Brown (D-Ore.) struck a deal to have state police take over protection of the courthouse. Brown and other officials said the federal agents were leaving town, but federal officials were cagey about who — if anyone — was leaving.  Joshi maintained that caginess Thursday as O’Scannlain asked what the “status” is of the agents that were sent to Portland.  “I don’t think it’s a matter in the record or of public record,” Joshi said.\"}\n",

Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in late 2017 and who Trump considered for an earlier vacancy, is considered the leading contender, according to four people familiar with the matter. She has strong support inside the White House Counsel’s office, which had already vetted her paperwork when she was nominated for the appellate court, according to one of the people.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed Friday night that the nominee will be put to the Senate floor for a vote, though some of his fellow Republicans balked and Democrats quickly called for a delay until after the Nov. 3 election when control of the White House and Senate could flip.  Trump was initially left in the dark about Ginsburg’s death while on stage for a campaign rally in Bemidji, Minn., according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.  After Trump walked off the stage, making a fist pump to the beat of the Village People’s “YMCA,” the president was seen talking to top aides John McEntee and Dan Scavino while he walked over to reporters.  “She just died?” Trump asked, touching his ear to hear a reporter ask him about the news as Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” played in the background from the rally. “Wow, I didn’t know that. You’re telling me now for the first time. She led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman, whether you agreed or not, she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life. I’m actually sad to hear that. I am sad to hear that.”  He then turned to board Air Force One back to Washington.  The White House started working Friday night, just after word of Ginsburg\\'s death around 7:30 p.m., to quickly assemble a communications team needed to push through the confirmation, according to a person close to the White House. \"The discussions are happening right now,” the person said.  The effort was immediately seen by Trump aides and allies as a potential game-changer for their struggling campaign, with the president under fire throughout the spring and summer for his coronavirus response and struggling economy.  “Now every conservative that’s on the fence knows what’s at stake,” a former White House official said.  With just over six weeks before the election, national polls show Trump lagging far behind Democratic nominee Joe Biden. His standing has fallen in many key states, such as Ohio and Iowa, and even in traditionally red states, such as Arizona and Georgia, in both public and campaign polls.  That’s in part because Trump has struggled to craft a coherent case for his reelection and has spent months veering from one hot-button issue to another. But the Supreme Court fight will focus the campaign and energize supporters in a way little else could have, according to interviews with half a dozen Trump allies.  \"All this election stuff and we signed an [executive order] on this or that — it doesn\\'t matter,” a White House official said. “This is the election.”  Trump frequently touts the hundreds of federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed and confirmed during his tenure, even if he often inflates the total number. It was a point he made again Friday night while on stage in Minnesota.  “It shows our voters that’s why they elected him in the first place and that’s why he needs to be reelected,” a Republican close to the president said.  “The left is already activated and Trump has coalesced the left faster than they’ve ever been able to do before,” said Lanza, the former campaign aide. “This brings home disaffected Republicans because now they know what’s really at stake.”  Trump released a list of potential picks for a vacancy last week, months after the Supreme Court dealt him a series of blows on cases pertaining to hot-button issues that have fired up his base of conservative evangelicals in the past, including immigration, abortion and LGBTQ protections.  “Any nominee should have a long record of being a constitutional conservative — applying the law and not making it up,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that is in touch with the White House.  He said “it’s doable” for Trump to fill the seat before the election, given that Ginsburg’s nomination took just 42 days from the day President Bill Clinton nominated her to the final Senate vote in the summer of 1993, according to the Congressional Research Service. (The average number of days from nomination to confirmation since 1975 is nearly 70 days.)  Trump released his first list of potential picks for a vacancy during the 2016 campaign, a move that helped bring skeptical social conservatives into his camp enough to support his upset victory over Hillary Clinton.  “We are not running solely on the Covid response and the economy,” said Dan Eberhart, a major Republican donor and CEO of a drilling services company. “This resets the race.”  Nancy Cook, Daniel Lippman and Tina Nguyen contributed to this report.'}\n",

Shifting attitudes of white college-educated voters in the suburbs of Maricopa County, and Trump himself, have also contributed to the state’s changing political landscape.  “There\\'s room for Joe Biden to grow his support among Latinos in Arizona in this last 50 days,” said Stephanie Valencia, co-founder of Equis Research, which hired GBAO Strategies to conduct the poll. “There\\'s a lot of room for him to continue to make his case to these younger Hispanic men who may be intrigued by Trump but aren\\'t totally sold on voting for him yet.”  Trump\\'s support increased by 8 points among Latinos in Arizona compared with the president’s 2019 average in four waves of Equis polling. After weekend events in Nevada, Trump held a Latino roundtable in Phoenix on Monday.  Valencia attributed the shift to “Trump intrigue” around the president’s business personality. Latino men under the age of 50 represented the greatest statistical bump for Trump since an Equis’ poll from May. The boost for Trump among young Latino men could be a product of a smaller subsample, Valencia said. But even if the true change were half the size, she said, “we would come to the same conclusion: young men have been increasingly moving toward Trump.”  “While more than 40 percent say they are supporting Trump today,” Valencia added. “Only 26 percent rate themselves very likely to support him at the end of the day.”  As the election nears, Biden’s campaign has rushed to shore up more Latino support, particularly in the battleground of Florida where he appears to be underperforming Clinton among Latinos in the state. Biden is heading to Florida on Tuesday for a Hispanic heritage event and a veterans\\' roundtable.  In Arizona, Biden’s team is aiming to win at least 70 percent of the Latino vote — the same share of Latinos Sen. Kyrsten Sinema won in her 2018 race when she became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Arizona since the 1980s. Latinos will be one of the crucial blocs to determine who wins the pivotal Maricopa County and can help in the Democratic-leaning Pima County.  “The path to victory here in Arizona, and in some other states, runs through the Latino community,” Jessica Mejía, Biden’s Arizona state director, told POLITICO earlier this month.  Arizona Latinos preferred Biden on every issue polled, leading Trump by 44 points on who voters thought would best handle health care issues. When asked who would do a better job of handling the coronavirus, 67 percent of voters preferred Biden, compared with 25 percent for Trump. On immigration, Biden led 67-27 percent. He also led on the economy, with 57 percent compared with Trump\\'s 35 percent.  Valencia said that when Latinos are given more details about Biden\\'s platform, his favorability rises because the former vice president is still undefined among the group. The poll also found that Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly, who has steadily led Republican Sen. Martha McSally in polls, is outperforming Biden with Latinos in the state.  Arizona Latinos favor Kelly over McSally 65 percent to 27 percent. The poll surveyed 600 registered Latino voters in English and Spanish across Arizona from Aug. 20-Sept. 2, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.  Seventy-one percent of Latinos in Arizona said they’re “very motivated” to vote.  Biden’s statewide lead in Arizona, where he is ahead of Trump by an average of 5 points, is also boosted by his numbers with white voters. Biden is ahead of Trump by 22 points with white college-educated voters in the state, according to a monthly tracking poll by Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights. Trump won that same group by 6 points in 2016. The shift among college-educated white voters has materialized in the suburbs of other battlegrounds as well. But Valencia cautioned Democrats against overconfidence in the Grand Canyon State.  \"If the election were held today, Biden would probably win in a place like Arizona based on where he\\'s sitting with white support,” she said. Still, Valencia said, Biden faces a challenge if there\\'s any fluctuation in white voter support — even if it\\'s just a couple of points.  \"If Democrats have not done the work to increase support among Latinos to close that gap then that is when there will be trouble,\" Valencia said.'}\n",

The showdown came as historic wildfires have displaced tens of thousands of residents up and down the West Coast, tinged the sky a red-orange hue and created some of the world’s worst air quality in parts of California. At least 35 people are dead across California, Oregon and Washington, and more than 3 million acres of land have been scorched.  In remarks from Wilmington, Del., the former vice president pitched himself as the only choice to combat climate change shortly ahead of Trump’s first visit to view the damage in California from the fires that have been raging for weeks.  “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more America ablaze?” Biden said. “If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?”  Trump faced a more direct confrontation at his event here in California’s capital, from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Wade Crowfoot, the head of the state’s Natural Resources Agency.  “I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means for our forests and actually work together with that science,” Crowfoot told the president at the wildfire briefing, which featured local and federal officials involved in combating the fires. Crowfoot emphasized to the president that “science is going to be key.”  While he applauded Trump’s focus on forest management as a method of controlling and fighting wildfires, Crowfoot warned Trump not to “ignore” the science of climate change, arguing that it would be misguided to “sort of put our heads in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management,” a course of action he said would not ultimately protect Californians.  Trump, however, pushed back on Crowfoot’s assessment, telling the secretary that “it’ll start getting cooler, just watch.”  “I don’t think the science agrees with you,” Crowfoot responded, to which Trump countered: “I don’t think science knows, actually.”  After the briefing, Crawfoot fired back at the president on Twitter, posting a graph of California’s average temperature from June to September, with a trendline showing that figure steadily increasing over the last four decades.  “It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal,” Crowfoot wrote.  Newsom, a Democrat with whom Trump has had a hot-and-cold relationship, also challenged the president on his views, even as he acknowledged that Trump was unlikely to change them.  “I’d be negligent, and this is not — we’ve known each other too long and as you suggest, the working relationship, I value,” he told the president. “We obviously feel very strongly that the hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier.”  “Something’s happened to the plumbing of the world and we come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident, that climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this,” he continued, urging Trump to “please respect the difference of opinion out here with respect to this fundamental issue of climate change.”  “Absolutely,” the president responded.  Climate change is playing a role in the severity of the fires, which are expected to increase in frequency in future years. The U.S. endured its fourth-hottest summer ever recorded amid an abnormally dry season, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That helped create the volatile conditions on the heels of the nation’s sixth-warmest winter, as lightning strikes ignited West Coast blazes even before official wildfire season began.  “Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes, but if he gets a second term these hellish events will continue to become more common, more devastating and more deadly,” Biden said on Monday.  Biden laid out the consequences of climate change along the nation’s coasts and in suburbs, pointing to the health concerns stemming from wildfires and other natural disasters that disproportionately affect communities of color, as well as the massive costs to the economy and the national security threats posed by sea-level rise.  “With every bout of nature’s fury, caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation, whether they’re in big cities, small towns, on coastlines or farm lands,” Biden said. “It’s happening everywhere and it’s happening now, and it affects us all.”  Biden also took aim at Trump’s central campaign theme on law and order, using the same phrasing he has employed when criticizing Trump’s response to the protests that swept across the country to attack him on his lack of action on climate change.  “It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America,” Biden said. “This is Donald Trump’s America. He’s in charge.”  Trump has also warned that immigration is threatening U.S. suburbs, an assertion that Biden called “ridiculous” in his remarks.  “You know what is actually threatening our suburbs?” he said “Wildfires are burning the suburbs of the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighbors in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast. If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighborhoods will be flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away by superstorms?”  Biden positioned Trump’s policies and actions as “backward-looking politics” that will stand to harm the environment, make communities less healthy and hold back economic progress.  “It’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate and to win,” Biden said, pointing instead to his own climate plan, which calls for making buildings more energy-efficient, boosting clean-energy jobs and expanding electric transportation.  “We have to act as a nation,” Biden said. “It shouldn’t be so bad that millions of Americans live in the shadow of an orange sky and are left asking, ‘Is Doomsday here?’”'}\n",

The findings — including that 8 in 10 Americans agree that “without our freedoms America is nothing” — could be telling in an election that features President Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, battling each other to claim the mantle of uniter in chief while the country faces coinciding crises of public health and economic and racial justice.  Several of the rights and freedoms that an overwhelming bipartisan majority viewed as essential to being an American, however, go far beyond those provided directly by the Constitution, like freedom of speech and religion.  The right to clean air and water, for example, was considered important by 93 percent of those surveyed; protection of personal data, by 93 percent; the right to a quality education, by 92 percent; racial equality, by 92 percent; affordable health care, by 89 percent; and the right to a job, by 85 percent.  Of 16 rights and values polled, a majority considered every single one either very or somewhat important to being American today.  Even issues like immigration (66 percent) and protecting a woman’s right to choose and make decisions affecting her body and personal life (72 percent) — typically viewed as highly divisive — garnered bipartisan support, though with more of a partisan divide.  The survey found its biggest partisan gap on the issue of race and policing. Although more than 6 in 10 agreed that Black Americans and other racial minorities are targets of racism in policing, that total included 84 percent of Democrats compared with just 32 percent of Republicans.  To be sure, many of the issues that Americans agree on are areas that both Trump and Biden — and, more generally, Republicans and Democrats — have campaigned on, though with sometimes drastically different approaches.  “The fact that they’re answering these questions in the context of what are the essential rights that are important to being an American today — so in other words this is just not about rights in the abstract, it’s about ‘who are we as Americans?’ — and in a sense this poll provides a pretty clear indication of what it is that people think is most important about being an American,” Shattuck said.  In what could be another telling sign ahead of the November election, overwhelming bipartisan majorities of Americans reported a shift in how they view the role and responsibility of government in protecting rights and the responsibility of citizens to fellow citizens following the events of the past several months — including the coronavirus pandemic, the ensuing economic fallout and mass protests for racial justice.  The poll found that recent events had made 85 percent of Americans think differently about the role and responsibility of the government, including 90 percent of Democrats and 84 percent of Republicans. (A similar portion of Americans, 83 percent, said the events of the past few months had made them think differently about the responsibility of citizens to their fellow citizens.)  The survey reveals a resounding cynicism toward the government, with more than two-thirds (69 percent) agreeing that “I feel like the government doesn’t represent the America that I love.”  A 53 percent majority, though not a bipartisan one, said that the events of the past few months had caused them to have less respect for the government, including 64 percent of Democrats, 41 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of independents.  Americans were more likely to say that various rights are “not very secure“ than “very secure,“ the poll found. And in most cases in which Americans viewed their rights as being in danger, the government and politicians were considered the greatest threat to these rights, along with fellow citizens and corporations.  While 87 percent agreed that “the government has a responsibility to protect the lives, livelihoods, and rights of all Americans,” more than half — 54 percent — said they believe the government is not doing a good job of protecting those rights, including two-thirds of Democrats and one-third of Republicans.  Shattuck took a bleak view of Americans’ lack of confidence in their government.  “There’s ... a strong belief that rights are under threat and that the principal dangers are coming from government and politicians,” he said, “and I guess my concern here is democracy really is at risk when the very values that Americans believe they have in common are under attack.”  When it comes to the November election, Shattuck said, “it’s clear that voters are all going to be thinking about their values … so that’s something the candidates are going to have to take into consideration.”  “The poll shows that a majority of Americans are fed up with polarization and looking for ways to reimagine the values they have in common — the rights and responsibilities important to being an American today,” he added later.  The project included the nationwide poll as well as focus groups held in Detroit, Phoenix and Atlanta. The data will be used to produce a report and policy recommendations based on its findings that is set to be released in October, and that Shattuck said would be “written for the next president of the United States, whoever they may be.”  The poll was conducted July 6-28 among a nationwide sample of 2,093 people by NORC, an independent research institution at the University of Chicago. The margin of sampling error for the study is plus or minus 2.76 percentage points.'}\n",

He is working closely with a career government official who is serving as the federal transition coordinator — typically the type of worker Trump would label as part of the “Deep State.” And the Justice Department has already agreed to start pre-processing Biden officials’ security clearances just in case he wins, according to people familiar with the planning.  “They are very, very focused on implementing the law and doing it by the book, and they are doing a good job,” said David Marchick, director of the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.  Instead of on-the-fly decisions, staff infighting or governing by instinct — all hallmarks of Trump’s leadership style over the last four years — transition planning has happened quietly, efficiently and with little public fanfare.  The question is whether Liddell can maintain this level of professionalism if and when Trump starts paying more attention to the prospect of leaving office. Trump’s last transition team under Gov. Chris Christie also ran smoothly and made plans for hiring Cabinet officials and rolling out executive orders — until the Trump team fired Christie days after winning and threw his binders of plans in the trash.  “I suspect the president is totally unaware,” one former Obama transition official said about Trump and the transition plans. “It could go sideways as soon as he knows this is going on.”  A White House official said the president is aware of the transition work of Liddell, who has been at it for months.  “The Trump Administration has met and will continue to meet all requirements under the law as it relates to any needed transition between administrations,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.  In a political environment already gripped by Trump’s repeated refusal to agree to a peaceful transfer of power, both Democrats and some Republicans feel nervous about the road ahead. Democrats fear Trump could sabotage it by denying Biden aides access to federal agencies, slow-walking security clearances or, more broadly, questioning and undermining the results of the election for several weeks in November and December.  Friends and allies say Liddell is aware of the delicacy of the situation and is purposefully seeking to work under the radar. Liddell declined to comment.  Aiding Liddell in both the planning for a potential transition, or a second Trump term, is top White House attorney Pat Cipollone. Liddell and his team have also been working on a policy agenda for Trump if he wins a second term and are coordinating with the head of presidential personnel, John McEntee, on possible senior personnel picks for both the Cabinet and key White House posts.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, for instance, is not expected to stay on for four more years. And top aides have been eyeing Jim Donovan, a former partner from Goldman Sachs, to either replace Kudlow or take a top Treasury post. Neither Kudlow nor Donovan responded to requests for comment.  The White House handed Liddell the transition portfolio because of his past work on the transition team for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. During that period, Liddell served as the executive director of the roughly 600-person Romney transition team and made sure the operation, which functioned more like a consulting firm, met its deadlines, with timelines and deliverables.  “He knows how to run the machinery,” said Tim Adams, a former Romney transition official and a former top Treasury official. “Hopefully, they are leaving him alone and letting him do this job.”'}\n",

Grassroots Democrats are hyperactivated to take on Republican leaders like Graham, who once burnished a moderate reputation but has aligned closely with Trump.  Even in a state like South Carolina — which hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1976 and hasn’t elected a Democratic senator since Fritz Hollings won his final term in 1998 — it’s left even the best-funded Republicans in relatively safe seats drowning under a wave of Democratic cash that is cresting with the upcoming court fight.  What happened  Graham’s pleas have escalated over the past week since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, but trouble has been looming for the third-term senator for some time now. Harrison has outraised and outspent Graham in every fundraising period this year, and the polls have the candidates running neck and neck, despite Trump’s lead over Joe Biden in the state.  Harrison, the former state Democratic Party chair, brought in $14 million during the second quarter of this year, nearly lapping Graham’s $8.4 million. And the Democrat shelled out $11.8 million during that period, nearly double Graham’s $6.2 million.  Graham ended the quarter with $15 million in the bank to just $10.2 million for Harrison. But since then, Harrison’s fundraising has only picked up.  Harrison collected a combined $14.1 million from online donors via ActBlue, the Democratic-aligned fundraising platform, in July and August — more than his total fundraising for the whole second quarter, with a month to go in the third quarter. And Harrison’s campaign said he raised $2 million in 48 hours alone earlier this month, after a Quinnipiac University poll showed the two men deadlocked in the race.  Meanwhile, Graham — who once pledged that, just as he opposed an election-year Supreme Court nominee from then-President Barack Obama, he would oppose one from a Republican president — is set to play a key role in a new Supreme Court confirmation process, and Harrison\\'s money will likely keep flowing in.  Ginsburg’s death, and Republicans’ immediate insistence on filling the seat in the current Congress and before the end of Trump’s term, has supercharged Democratic fundraising. Harrison’s campaign declined to disclose how much he’s taken in so far — either in the week since Ginsburg’s passing or in the third quarter to-date.  What it means  Graham isn’t the only Republican being inundated by Democratic cash. The New York Times reported earlier this week that, just to the north, North Carolina Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham had raised $6 million in the days after Ginsburg’s death — more than doubling what his opponent, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, raised in the entire second quarter. And then there’s Sara Gideon, the Democratic state House speaker in Maine, who has been outraising endangered GOP Sen. Susan Collins for a year and is likely to see yet more money come in, even after Collins said she opposes Trump sending a nominee to the Senate before Election Day.  But Graham’s case is special. At the start of the election cycle, few handicappers gave Harrison a chance to knock off Graham, who has moved from premier Trump opponent and critic during the 2016 campaign to the president’s loyal ally and frequent golf partner.  Since he entered the race, Harrison has sought to exploit Graham’s shifting alliances, portraying him as inauthentic and power-hungry. And Graham’s flip-flop on the court appointment — in Oct. 2018, Graham said, “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait ‘till the next election” before filling the vacancy — has opened him up to new accusations of hypocrisy.  But attacking Graham on the court at the same time he’s presiding over hearings carries some risk, too. It could remind Republican voters who might be skeptical of Graham that he’s the point person in the Senate for moving the nomination. While South Carolina is undergoing the same kinds of demographic changes that have brought neighboring North Carolina and Georgia onto the presidential battlefield, it still leans Republican.  Graham’s vulnerability is rooted in his weakness among more conservative voters, who recall his pre-Trump image as a moderate voice: the dealmaking friend of maverick John McCain who pushed immigration reform, voted to confirm Obama’s Supreme Court nominees and trashed Trump. With upscale white voters in and around Charleston and Columbia drifting toward Democrats, Graham now needs the skeptical conservative base to propel him to victory.  Graham has attacked Harrison as too liberal for South Carolina, linking him to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and hitting him for his previous work as a lobbyist. And his campaign notes that Harrison hasn\\'t been shy about promoting his website and urging supporters to give him donations, either.  In a six-sentence statement provided for this article, Graham campaign communications director T.W. Arrighi mentioned the URL for Graham\\'s campaign website five times.  “The mainstream media is one giant in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party,\" Arrighi said in the two sentences that didn\\'t include the address for Graham\\'s website. \"Jaime Harrison’s hollow campaign relies 100 percent on outside donations and ads because he is hiding from the issues.\"  What’s next  The end of the third quarter next week means we’ll likely hear from both men soon about their fundraising from July through September. Reports are due to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.  In the meanwhile, Harrison’s boffo fundraising is giving him a massive advantage on the airwaves. According to Advertising Analytics, he spent $4.2 million on television this week alone — blowing Graham’s $1 million out of the water.  All told, Harrison has already spent $22.8 million and has another $15.5 million on the books, compared with $7.8 million spent and $1.9 million in future reservations for the incumbent.  “I am being killed financially,” Graham said on Fox News Channel in his first appearance of the day on Thursday. “This money is because they hate my guts.”  Harrison had a cheeky response on Twitter Thursday night: “Anybody else get the sense that @LindseyGrahamSC just realized he\\'s going to lose on November 3rd?”'}\n",

And though the first-term Republican still sees a path for Trump to win and said nothing critical of the president, he also indicated he’s running as a check on a potential President Biden.  “The best check on a Biden presidency is for Republicans to have a majority in the Senate. And I do think \\'checks and balances\\' does resonate with North Carolina voters,” he said.  North Carolina is one of a handful of top-tier states that will determine the majority. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 advantage, but Democrats are favored to win in Arizona and Colorado. Republicans have an edge in Alabama, and races in Iowa and Maine are highly competitive. Democrats have also pushed races in deeper red territory like Alaska, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas into play, broadening their path back to power.  But Josh Holmes, a close confidant to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said “without question the clearest pathway\" for Democrats to win the Senate was through North Carolina. \"And it looks like Cal Cunningham sexted it away.”  Steven Law, who runs Senate Leadership Fund, the powerful super PAC closely aligned with McConnell, conceded the race had “kind of frozen into place with a gap in polling between Tillis and Cunningham.” But now he sees a shake-up.  “It changes our potential for winning this race. I wouldn’t say it’s decisive, but it is a key ingredient. With the potential for winning North Carolina, I think it could build a bridge to holding the majority,” Law said.  A Democrat familiar with recent polling said that while voters are aware of the affair, and the race may tighten, “people are not shifting their support.” And Democrats scoff at the possibility voters will punish Cunningham after Trump has been repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct, including the president\\'s own words in the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which was released a month before the 2016 election.  “It\\'s a little bit hard for me to take seriously the Republican shock and horror about whatever this guy did,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “Pretty much whatever any Democratic candidate could do has been eclipsed by what Donald Trump does every day that Republicans cover for.”  But Tillis says this is different because Cunningham was making character, integrity and a military background such an integral part of his race. Last Friday, outlets reported that Cunningham sent sexually suggestive texts to Arlene Guzman Todd, a California PR executive and the wife of an Army veteran. Guzman Todd later confirmed at least one intimate encounter with Cunningham \"during a period of marital separation.\" Cunningham is an Army reservist, and the Army said this week it is investigating the allegations.  “The whole premise of Cal Cunningham’s campaign has imploded over the past four days. So clearly it’s going to be a factor,” Tillis said. “I’m not going to call on him to get out of the race. I’m calling on him to be transparent and provide a full explanation.”  Cunningham has resumed campaign activities after Tillis’s coronavirus infection forced the two candidates to quarantine. He lashed Tillis for not clinching a deal on more coronavirus relief on Thursday in a news release that made no mention of Cunningham’s cloud of scandal.  Rachel Petri, a spokeswoman for Cunningham, said Tillis is behind in the race due to his positions on health care and “colossally botching the response to this pandemic.”  “Now he’s trying to exploit a personal matter to make desperate attacks in hopes it saves his political career,” Petri said.  Republicans are now running ads against Cunningham’s indiscretion and judgment, but they’re being outspent. Cunningham’s campaign is set to swamp Tillis on the airwaves over the next week. Among outside groups, Democrats have slightly more money booked for TV ads than Republicans, according to data from Advertising Analytics.  North Carolina is a major presidential swing state — but in polls prior to the past week, Tillis was running behind Trump. His evolution from a senator who stood against Trump’s national emergency on the border and negotiated on immigration with Democrats to among the most steadfast Trump defenders left him vulnerable. Last fall, he was squeezed by conservatives who saw him as a weak defender of the president, then appealed to the right to ward off a brief primary challenge.  But with Cunningham staggering, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said there’s now “reason for us to be at least hopeful” about keeping the chamber.  “When you set yourself up and raise the bar really high for yourself and crash and burn at your own hand, that’s a pretty hard thing to overcome,” he said of Cunningham. “The entire majority of the United States Senate could rest not just on this one race, but this one issue.”  Democrats say their core message that Tillis is too close to Trump and too hellbent on scrapping Obamacare will not change.  “Republicans are in a really tough place nationally, and they\\'re trying to hang on. But what they can\\'t lose sight of is what matters most to the voters,” said JB Poersch, who runs the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, which is heavily invested in North Carolina.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Thursday declined to comment on the race but pointed to a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee statement backing Cunningham. John Verdejo, a Democratic National Committee member in North Carolina, said there was disappointment over the affair, but not to the point that people are “turning their back on Cal Cunningham.”  “I kind of look at it as an act of desperation,” he said of Republicans’ new tactics. “They have nothing else to run on.”  Tillis would probably be in even better shape politically had he not contracted coronavirus last week, one of three recent infections in the Senate GOP. He was photographed without a mask at a White House reception for Trump\\'s Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett, though he wore one while outside at her nomination announcement.  Tillis is set to return to Washington next week to push through Barrett\\'s nomination from his perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said in the interview that everyone in the room had been tested for Covid-19 and called his infection a “testament that you should never let your guard down.” Asked whether Cunningham might have let his guard down in a close Senate race, Tillis scoffed.  “He let his family down. And he let his supporters down for months. And it just happened to come to light,” Tillis said. “He didn’t let his guard down. He made a decision.”  '}\n",

And maybe nobody knows who Larry Kudlow is but he’s telling you he’s the expert!”  “She immediately, and throughout, saw the power of the hundred-thousand-job argument,” Reines said recently in an interview, “and how it helped Trump steamroll over 17 non-businesspeople in the Republican primaries.\"  After watching hours of Trump’s debates from 2015 and 2016, what comes across in hindsight is that he had an under-appreciated style, strategy, and message. He was not the Donald Trump of Twitter, where he launches his crudest attacks. He was not the Donald Trump of MAGA rallies, where he feeds off the crowd and plays a role that is a mix of demagogue, right-wing pundit, and entertainer.  The matchup with Biden will be much different. Trump is an unpopular incumbent with a record to defend. He no longer has as clear a message as he did in 2016. Biden has the benefit of four extra years to study Trump.  But the conventional wisdom about Trump arriving in Cleveland Tuesday as a manic and extremely, well, Trumpy, debater could be wrong. Trump won the Republican nomination partly on the strength of his debate appearances. And while post-debate polls were generally favorable to Hillary in 2016, Trump’s three general election debates were crucial to his victory.  Maybe everything is different this year, but the debates offer the best — and last — opportunity for Trump to turn around the race.  Attention at all costs  Watching the first Republican presidential primary debates of the 2016 campaign with the benefit of experiencing Trump on the national stage for five years is revelatory.  Most of the other Republican candidates share an understanding of what conservatism means and what presidential candidates should look and sound like.  The media moderators share an understanding of what a candidate can and can’t get away with.  Since we now know the ending, watching Jeb Bush talk about his optimistic vision for America or seeing Chris Wallace react indignantly when Trump bulldozes through a question with a flurry of bombast and nonsense can be painful. Watching these old clips now, it’s mind-boggling how easy it was for Trump to play the media and his opponents.  The tone was set at the very first debate on Aug. 6, 2015, in Cleveland. Fox’s Bret Baier asks if any of the 10 candidates on stage is not willing to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee or promise not to mount an independent campaign in the fall, something Trump had flirted with publicly.  Trump, standing in the center because he’s already at the top of the polls, is wearing his candidate uniform of blue suit and extra long shiny red tie. He looks around, sees that nobody else is raising his hand and puts his own in the air. The crowd loudly boos him and Trump responds with an exaggerated shrug and outstretched palms.  Naturally, the moderators, channeling the outrage of the Republican audience, ignore the other nine candidates and press Trump on his supposed heresy.  “To be clear, you’re standing on a Republican primary debate stage,” Baier says. The camera zooms in on Trump and his face fills the screen.  “I fully understand,” Trump interjects. And he did. It was everyone else in politics and media who didn’t.  At the end of the first debate Bush wags his finger at Trump’s obnoxious tone. “We don’t have time for tone,” Trump responds.  Trump kept himself as the center of attention at the next 11 debates. Aside from a couple of days in November 2015, he was the polling leader for the rest of the primary. Moderators would challenge him by noting what “experts say” or asking him to “share your proof with the American people” about some absurd claim and Trump would talk about why “we don’t win anymore” or how the press is “a very dishonest lot.”  Whenever Trump would be challenged about his personal criticisms of other candidates he would escalate. “I never attacked him on his looks and believe me there’s plenty of subject matter there,” he said about Rand Paul in the second debate. The purpose was to remain the focus at all costs, and it worked. The rules said that if another candidate mentioned you then you got to respond. Trump made sure he was mentioned.  At the third debate, in October, an exasperated Mike Huckabee was asked if Trump had the character to be president. “As few questions as I’ve got, the last one I need is to give him some more time!” he said. Someone was finally onto the strategy, but it was too late.  He lies: When Jeb Bush accurately says Trump lobbied him on casino gambling in Florida, Trump admonishes, “Don’t make things up!” He cites unnamed experts endorsing his views: “Some of the greatest scholars agree with me,” he tells Carly Fiorina about birthright citizenship. He brags about his scandals: “I used the laws of the country to my benefit,” he said of his company’s multiple bankruptcies. “I’m sorry.”  A more reserved Trump  By the general election, Trump had most of the Republican Party behind him and his ragtag operation had some operatives with traditional campaign experience guiding it, including Kellyanne Conway, who convinced him to tone things down.  If watching the Republican primary debates of 2015 and 2016 is jarring for how effective Trump was at using a shock jock schtick to dominate a political campaign, watching the 2016 general election debates is jarring for how relatively restrained Trump could be.  Simply commanding the spotlight— crucial in a 17-candidate field — was no longer a wise strategy in a two-person race. But watching the debates knowing that Trump would defeat Clinton by winning over white working-class voters reveals Trump to be cannier in his messaging than he was given credit for at the time.  The issues that flummoxed Clinton during debate prep proved to be deadly. “In 2016 he had his message killers: immigration, trade, Obamacare, and corruption in Washington,” Reines said.  In the early moments of the first debate, which was the most-watched period of the three matchups, the two candidates outline their economic visions. Clinton was cogent and talked about a series of specific policies like raising the minimum wage, paid family leave, affordable child care and debt-free college. There was a dash of populism when she talked about “having the wealthy pay their fair share” and closing corporate loopholes.  It all seems so clear now, but it’s like watching a horror movie where you can’t believe another victim is going to fall prey to the same mistakes that Rubio and Jeb made when they were drowned in the lake by Trump.  When it’s Trump’s turn to talk about the economy, he launches into a simplistic riff about the world taking advantage of Americans. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” Trump begins. He blames it all on Mexico and China and the other foreign countries using America as a piggy bank to rebuild their own countries. The Obama administration’s refusal “to fight them” is the problem. On the issues that he did have details about, they were skeletal, like his promise to cut corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 15 percent, which he said would be an explosive “job creator” would “be a beautiful thing to watch.”  Clinton was cerebral and hemmed in by only proposing things she genuinely believed were possible to pass into law as president.  Trump was visceral and unencumbered by any sense of what might work or what was possible to get through Congress.  There were sporadic outbursts from Trump through the three debates that had nothing to do with his four pillars. He threatened to jail Clinton. During the second debate, in the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape, when it seemed his candidacy might implode, he made a spectacle of the evening by inviting to the event several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or sexual harassment.  But what comes across watching these events back-to-back is the power of Trump’s populism and demagoguery and the relative restraint he showed compared to what we have seen on his Twitter feed and at his press conferences for much of this year.  Reines, who has studied Trump’s debating style as much as anyone, agreed with that assessment. “He had his four pillars, and a well honed attack on Hillary,” he said. “He spent nominal time defending himself even in the face of the most egregious incidents, like Access Hollywood.”  There was a Trump formula for almost every question a moderator posed that might be uncomfortable for him. In the first debate, Lester Holt asked Trump about releasing his tax returns, a topic certain to come up tonight. His response set the pattern he would use for all three events.  “I don\\'t mind releasing — I\\'m under a routine audit,” he said. “And it\\'ll be released. And — as soon as the audit\\'s finished, it will be released.” Trump then bragged about how he made $694 million the previous year. Then he pivoted to discussing trade deficits and the “political hacks negotiating our trade deals.” He finished by proposing he release his tax returns “when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.”  Reines described that three-step response that Trump patented in 2016 as, “word salad, weird digression, I’m great and she’s terrible.”  There is a good case that the political dynamics of 2020 are completely different. It’s always easier in American politics to run as an outsider against the establishment. Successful presidential candidates as different as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all profited from that strategy. Trump now has the burden of trying to defend an objectively poor record on the central issue of 2020: his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. His message is not as simple and clear as it was in 2020.  Though it\\'s perhaps a tad self-serving, Reines has become convinced that Trump\\'s message was so effective in 2016 that no Democrat would have fared better than Hillary Clinton. He described some revelatory moments during debate prep when he was doing his best to inhabit the character of Trump but all that was really coming out were the words.  \"What’s scary is that I’m dressed like him and I have the Trump mannerisms, but I’m not crazy,\" he said. \"I’m still Philippe Reines. And when you hear me saying what he says, you see the power of it. Even without any of the crazy stuff. It’s why Biden or Bernie would not have beaten him.\"  In his view, the fact that Trump has a real governing record and is unpopular — 45 percent job approval — changes everything. Clinton struggled to make the case that Trump would be the wrong person to lead the country through a crisis, and his act was still a novelty to many Americans willing to give him a chance. But Biden has the benefit of being able to ignore much of Trump\\'s familiar histrionics and instead focus clearly on his record.  Reines\\'s two pieces of advice for Biden were \"not to overthink it\" — Trump is not that sophisticated — and to serve as a narrator of Trump\\'s tactics for viewers at home by declaring early on that what they will hear from Trump Tuesday night can\\'t be trusted.  \"He has to beat him to the punch,\" Reines said. \"They don’t have opening statements, but I would start with \\'I’ve served with and for eight presidents before you, and I never thought I would say this to a president but most of what you hear from him tonight will be false.’\"  Still, last time around Trump learned to master and dominate the debates in the Republican primary, and he was extraordinarily effective against someone as skilled as Hillary Clinton in the three general election debates. He shouldn’t be underestimated.'}\n",

Collins is on track to lose her seat representing Maine — and how the race marks the end of an era for moderates.  The fusillade of charges comes in response to a barrage of anti-Collins ads that portray her as in the pocket of big business, timid in the face of President Donald Trump and worst of all, losing the support of the state’s famously independent voters. The race has featured nearly $90 million in TV ads and will see another $25 million or more over the home stretch, according to an analysis of media buys, making it easily the most expensive race in Maine history.  Collins’ 24 years in the Senate, where she carefully cultivated the image of a pragmatic centrist, is now in serious danger of being washed away under a flood of ads and rising anti-Trump fervor. And if she goes down, the Senate Republican majority may go with her.  Collins has not led a public poll since July and is increasingly viewed by handicappers as an underdog after crushing her competition in her last three election campaigns. Poll averages show Gideon leading by 6 points, though a Bangor Daily News poll on Tuesday showed her trailing by just one point. The state uses ranked-choice voting, adding to the complexities in the race.  Collins would not concede anything, only offering that the race is “essentially tied.”  “It’s very frustrating because it’s backed by so much money. And it\\'s been going on for two years now: Non-stop negative ads. That eventually it pulls you down,” Collins said of the campaign against her. “What\\'s amazing is that I’m still going to win.”  Gideon’s campaign declined to respond to Collins in an interview, asserting her schedule was too packed. Typically, challengers to high-profile senators will do any media they can get to boost their message, but Gideon seems happy not to make waves.  Polls have given Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon a small edge. | Robert F. Bukaty/AP Photo  “Senator Collins’ votes for 181 of Trump’s far-right judicial nominees, for the corporate tax giveaway that put Mainers’ health care in jeopardy and her continued refusal to stand up to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump show just how much she\\'s changed after 24 years in Washington,” said Maeve Coyle, a Gideon spokeswoman, in a statement. “Her desperate, misleading attacks on Sara make clear that she’s willing to do anything to stay there.”  Collins built her brand to withstand the political winds no matter which way they blew, with a focus on deal-cutting, accessibility and delivering for her state. She will be the Senate Appropriations chairman if her party can keep the Senate. And Collins almost surely must win for there to be any hoping of preventing a Democratic takeover.  Republicans describe Collins as wounded but still in it. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Democrats have “have hit Susan so hard they’re working now on scar tissue.”  “She can survive the onslaught. But it’s a challenge,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an ally.  Collins’ precarious position reflects how it’s become borderline impossible to carry on as a middle-of-the-road Republican in the Trump era. Her appeals to the dwindling center incite mockery on the left, particularly when she gently chides the president. On the right, conservatives are upset about her opposition to filling the vacant Supreme Court seat, though former Gov. Paul LePage (R), never a robust Collins fan, said people should still “pinch your nose and vote for her.”  Collins had been pushing hard for another relief package to combat the coronavirus and deliver aid to millions of jobless Americans, but Trump killed negotiations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a tweet Tuesday — a “huge mistake,” Collins said. From immigration reform to background checks on gun sales, it was just the latest example of Trump and Collins working at cross purposes.  “Bipartisan work has become harder. I don’t think this president has helped make things any easier,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).  Murkowski herself is “struggling” with whether to support Trump and said she would be “very lonely” if Collins lost. The two make up the sum of moderate Republicans currently serving in the Senate.  A significant factor in Collins’ race is also the one she is most reluctant to address: Trump’s reelection campaign. She refuses to reveal whether she will vote for Trump — a tactic that vulnerable Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) used successfully four years ago, albeit when Trump wasn’t yet president.  Collins did not support Trump in 2016. But she dismissed the issue in an interview, saying that “nobody” asked her about it on a recent swing through the state.  “I wish the president would not tweet insults. There’s a lot about his style that is completely opposite of mine. But that doesn’t mean that he isn’t right on some issues,” she said, listing his aggressive trade policies toward China and his focus on tax cuts.  “My personal presidential preference, I do not believe is an important factor in this race. I’m not saying that the left is not trying to tie me to Donald Trump … they clearly are,” Collins said. But with her votes to save the Affordable Care Act and against some of Trump’s more controversial nominees like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, “my independence is the same as it’s always been.”  Betsy Sweet, who ran against Gideon in the Senate Democratic primary from the left, said both candidates are running “incessant” attack ads and talking “very little about what they are for.”  Gideon’s “ahead, and I think there definitely is caution there in terms of talking to people and being involved in public debates,” Sweet said of the campaign. “There’s a little bit of: ‘Let’s keep our head down.’”  That’s not a luxury Collins has as she fights her own party on a Supreme Court vacancy and pushes for a deal on a new coronavirus package. And every time Trump finds himself mired in controversy, she’s asked to opine.  Stuck in Washington last week when she was supposed to be touring Maine, Collins wants to make the race a side-by-side comparison between a four-term senator and a statehouse speaker. She said Gideon is “not doing her job in Maine” as speaker by adjourning the legislature and not doing more to address the pandemic, though Democrats say the blame lies with state Republicans for declining to participate in reconvening.

And she suggested Gideon has explaining to do on Dillon Bates, a former state legislator accused of having sexual relationships with students as a teacher. Senate Republicans’ campaign arm launched an ad Tuesday accusing Gideon of a “cover up.”  “Sara’s own spokesperson conceded that Sara had known about this for a long time. And actually said that Sara told Dillon Bates that, should [the scandal] become public, he would have to go. Now, why, whether or not it became public would be the triggering event, and why she didn’t ask for an investigation, are legitimate issues,” Collins said.  Gideon had been aware of the rumors before they became public and was the first legislator to call on Bates to resign, but did not call for an investigation, according to local news outlet WCSH.  In their last debate, Gideon accused Collins of pushing the courts “far to the right” by supporting most of Trump’s judges. And Collins\\' vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court provided a huge jolt in the push to defeat her. Now Collins finds herself standing with Murkowski against the efforts of 51 GOP colleagues trying to fill the vacancy filled by the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Collins keeps a photo of her and other female senators alongside Ginsburg and former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in her Senate hideaway. Collins quickly came out against filling Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat before election, but her position was ignored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is moving quickly to confirm Amy Coney Barrett.  The episode shows Collins’ willingness to break with her party — and the limits of a lonely moderate’s influence in an increasingly conservative GOP.  “I was saddened by [Ginsburg’s] death to start with. And disappointed that there was a rush to fill the vacancy,” Collins said. “Confirming conservative [and] moderate to conservative judges is Mitch McConnell’s top priority. So, our goals are very different.”  John Bresnahan and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.'}\n",

While she was not in the spotlight like some of the other attorneys who worked on the case, Lagoa spent time with Gonzalez family members and played a key role in sharpening the legal attack on President Bill Clinton’s administration, which wanted to send the young boy back to Cuba.  “Her nickname in the group was Barbara ‘The Hammer’ Lagoa,” recalled Linda Osberg-Braun, an immigration attorney who worked on the case against deportation. “She hammered the legal points in her legal arguments.”  Lagoa, now 52, herself the child of Cuban exiles who fled from the island nation the year before she was born, was a lawyer at the firm of Greenberg Traurig when she became part of the legal team that worked pro bono on the federal lawsuit. Those fighting to keep Gonzalez in Florida said they worried Gonzalez’s father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was being pressured by the Cuban government to demand the boy’s return.  As the case was still progressing in the courts, federal Border Patrol agents wearing body armor entered the house where Gonzalez was living in Miami’s Little Havana and took him away at gunpoint. He was reunited with his father hours later, but remained in the country while the asylum battle continued in the courts. Ultimately, Gonzalez’s relatives lost their case and the father and son returned to Cuba.  Lawyers who worked with Lagoa passionately recall how the case left Lagoa and others “heartbroken” and outraged after the seizure of Gonzalez.  “I think every one of us believed in the case,” said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney who worked with Lagoa on a federal lawsuit that sought to let Gonzalez remain in the United States. “We were saddened by the outcome and distraught by the paramilitary raid that seized Elian from a peaceful home in the dark of night.”  Florida Playbook Our must-read briefing on what’s hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

That outcome “seared into her soul” the importance of the rule of law, fellow lawyer and friend Eliot Pedrosa said during her investiture to the Florida Supreme Court last year.  Attorneys and acquaintances who know Lagoa said the case shaped her judicial philosophy, which calls for adhering to the “black letter” of the law, as Lagoa herself said during numerous judicial interviews.  At least half a dozen people who know Lagoa did not want to publicly discuss her background, even anonymously, as Trump mulls nominating the judge for the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at the age of 87. Despite boosterism by top Florida Republicans to put Lagoa on the high court, her strategy differs from Brett Kavanaugh, who had legions of supporters speaking on his behalf when he was up for nomination.  But one long-time acquaintance of Lagoa said that the “case was an example of a government agency not adhering to the plain meaning of the text.” Another Florida attorney who knows Lagoa said she told him the case helped form her philosophy and that her “reverence for separation of powers crystalized as the result of the events.” The two spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to comment publicly while Lagoa was still under consideration by the White House.  Lagoa, who has been a member of the conservative Federalist Society, touched on her philosophy briefly during her investiture to the Florida Supreme Court, where she sat for several months before landing on the federal appeals court last year. She said her parent’s refugee experience shaped her thinking on the law.  “We understand what it means when individual liberties, respect for private property and basic human rights are abandoned by government,” Lagoa said during the ceremony, held May 2019 in Tallahassee.  Lagoa was the first Hispanic woman and first Cuban American woman to serve on the Florida Supreme Court, to which she was nominated by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Lagoa also spent 12 years on a state appeals court after an appointment by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. She authored nearly 500 decisions and weighed in on thousands of others.  Lagoa has ruled against the government at times, notably in a case in which the state appeals court tossed a drug conviction after concluding police did a warrantless search. But, twice on the state Supreme Court, she authored opinions upholding DeSantis’ powers to suspend public officials by contending the state Supreme Court was limited in its ability to review such actions.  Lagoa was part of a federal appeals court ruling this month that upheld a contentious Florida law that requires felons to pay outstanding court debts in order to be eligible to register to vote. A group of Democratic senators — including vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris — said Lagoa had an obligation to recuse herself because she had sat on the state Supreme Court when it considered a different case tied to the law.  The decision to push for the removal of Gonzalez 20 years ago by federal authorities — including then Attorney General Janet Reno, the former Miami-Dade state attorney — enraged the Cuban American community. It seeped into that year’s presidential race and is viewed as one possible reason that then Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush. Bush defeated Gore in Florida by just 537 votes after the U.S. Supreme Court halted an ongoing recount.  How much of a role it played is up for debate, but in a year when the election was essentially tied, every vote counted.  The Elian Gonzalez debate “happened in the spring and there were many other factors influencing the election after that,” Jeb Bush, who was Florida’s governor at the time, said in an email to POLITICO. “But how the Clinton administration took the kid out of the home in Little Havana did not help Al Gore.”  Now the Gonzalez case seems like a prelude to the polarizing battles that swept up the country since then. After the federal raid, then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted the Border Patrol agents as “storm troopers using guns.”'}\n",

The group has clashed with President Donald Trump on issues including trade and immigration and is now facing an internal revolt over its decision to endorse a slate of vulnerable freshmen House Democrats for reelection. The move represented a major shift for the Chamber, which has long endorsed and funded Republican candidates and backed few Democrats in recent years. In 2014, the Chamber’s political director declared that making McConnell the majority leader was the group’s “number one priority.”  The organization has aired commercials backing several Senate GOP candidates in this election. But the outfit has pared back its electoral spending this year, investing just a fraction of what it devoted to the GOP’s push for the majority six years ago.  “It’s always an all hands on deck strategy to work with members of Congress to advance the priorities of our members,\" a Chamber spokesperson said in a statement. \"Our first priority is keeping a pro-growth Senate majority and we have exclusively put our money toward those races.\"  After Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterms, the Chamber signaled plans to take a more bipartisan approach. But senior GOP officials have lashed out at the lobbying group following its Democratic endorsements, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declaring that he no longer wanted the Chamber’s support.  Trump last week reached out to Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue to complain about the endorsements, a conversation that was first reported by Axios.  Howard — who previously worked for an array of top congressional Republicans, including ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott — cautioned that the Chamber shouldn’t assume that the “progress we made this year with House Democrats carry over this year to the Senate.”  But he said the Chamber’s network of local partners gave it “an important strategic advantage ... that a lot of groups don’t have,” adding that  “we should approach many of these offices, particularly on the Senate side, through our local Chamber partners to see if we can transfer any of that goodwill to a working relationship in Washington.”'}\n",

Skip the waitlist here.  Tech of the Town  TONIGHT’S THE NIGHT — The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former veep Joe Biden is set for 9 p.m. ET, and social media platforms are already bracing for potential problems. Twitter, for example, stressed Monday that it’ll be using a combination of human monitoring and automation to keep a close watch on trending content, hashtags and accounts that might violate site policies and to offer users accurate voter registration resources and authoritative information as context for inaccuracies from the candidates. (Monday’s MT looked at what tech talk could come up; read that here, ICYMI.)  TODAY: CORNYN TEAMS UP WITH MANCHIN ON SECTION 230 REFORM BILL — Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) today is slated to introduce his long-awaited bill to revamp Section 230 with a key Republican co-sponsor in tow: Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, according to Manchin’s office.  — Cornyn, long seen as a leading contender to succeed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as the chamber’s top Republican, gives Manchin a powerful new ally in his push to change the liability shield, which has come under fire from both parties.  — The skinny on the proposal: Manchin’s bill, as Cristiano first reported Friday, would require companies to report to federal authorities suspicious activity by users linked to major crimes or risk losing their Section 230 protections, which shields them from lawsuits for hosting third-party content and for taking steps to combat noxious material. It’s now the third bipartisan Senate bill to revamp Section 230 introduced this Congress, joining the PACT Act, S. 4066 (116), and the EARN It Act, S. 3398 (116). All three now have the backing of a member of Senate leadership or of a committee chairman, making each a legit threat to Section 230.  — Not a fan? The tech industry: The Internet Association — a leading tech trade association that counts Amazon, Google and Facebook as members — is already voicing concern. “The bill would put online services into the impossible position of determining what is or isn’t evidence of a crime, with crippling liability for failing to make the correct determination,” IA Deputy General Counsel Elizabeth Banker said in a statement.  ALSO TODAY: HOUSE TO VOTE ON EMERGING TECH BILLS — A number of tech and telecom bills are set to get consideration on the House floor today, with passage likely. They include: Rep. Jerry McNerney’s (D-Calif.) Consumer Safety Technology Act, H.R. 8128 (116), which would direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to use artificial intelligence to identify consumer product-related injuries; Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers’ (R-Wash.) American COMPETE Act, H.R. 8132 (116), which aims to boost U.S. innovation in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain; and H.R. 1289 (116), which would prevent consumers’ phone numbers from getting reassigned in the wake of disasters.  The U.S. Capitol is seen in Washington, D.C. | Samuel Corum/Getty Images  — And amid renewed talks, House Democrats floated a slimmed-down version of their coronavirus relief package, which still spends billions of dollars for broadband connectivity.  THE PERILS OF ZOOM HEARINGS — On the plus side, federal court hearings held via Zoom mean you can wear sweatpants. On the downside, so can everyone else. Monday’s Apple and Epic Games hearing drew a crowd — the Northern District of California reached its 500-person cap on Zoom more than 45 minutes beforehand, leaving many tech and court reporters (including POLITICO’s) without access. Intense public interest in the WeChat ban had a similar result: a Sept. 17 hearing in the same court with a 100-person limit filled up so quickly, the court increased the capacity to 500 for a follow-up hearing the next day (that one also maxed out).  — Livestreams: The court forbids any recording of hearings, and a notice on the California court’s website specifically calls out taking screen-shots or any other form of audio or visual copying. But a few gamers took the risk anyway, streaming the court proceedings on Twitch and YouTube for others to watch. At various points during the hearing, more than 1,600 people were watching those offshoot livestreams.  — Cameras in the court: The CARES Act authorized the federal courts to conduct business via teleconference and offered $6.5 million in additional funding. In April, the Judiciary asked Congress for $36.5 million more to help with additional health screening and technology enhancements during the pandemic. (Some in Congress have long pushed for the judicial branch to offer televised hearings. While few U.S. federal courts offer video, the U.S. Supreme Court and several of the appeals courts provide audio of arguments.)  BROADBAND LAND: TRUMP ADMIN TO BOOST 5G WORKFORCE TRAINING — The Department of Labor explicitly named 5G wireless network building as a goal when recently designating the Wireless Infrastructure Association as an industry intermediary to help train wireless workers — something that the association has long clamored for amid plans to spend millions of dollars on the effort. “We need to put the 5G job skills effort on steroids, and this is a nice big pill,” Jonathan Adelstetin, the group’s president, told John on Monday.  — Adelstein expects labor demand will remain high and as necessary as ever given the wireless industry\\'s recent interest in complex new network architecture ideas like opening the radio access networks (“open RAN”). “There’s going to be a crunch,” Adelstein maintained, pointing to the wireless carriers “firing a once,” the entry of new 5G player Dish Network, and builds related to the FCC’s recent auction of Citizens Broadband Radio Service airwaves.  — One lobbying fight to watch: Adelstein said that if Congress moves on a broadband infrastructure package, lawmakers should include legislation aimed at training more 5G network builders.  THE VIEW FROM EUROPE: SCHREMS II, PRIVACY SHIELD FALLOUT — With Ireland\\'s privacy agency at the finish line of likely deciding to forbid Facebook from using so-called “standard contractual clauses” to move data from the European Union to the United States, Max Schrems and his nonprofit organization, NOYB, asked dozens of other companies how they planned to keep the transatlantic data taps on.  — Their responses: Almost everyone (from Apple and Microsoft to Google and Facebook) said they would continue to use contractual clauses until told otherwise, adding that they were seeking guidance from EU regulators on how best to proceed. \"It seems so far too many EU companies point at the regulators and the regulators point at them to get going,\" Schrems told Morning Tech. \"At the same time, the U.S. data importers spread the message that there would be no problem.\"  — Not a problem… until there is one: Much will depend on Dublin\\'s decision on how to handle Facebook\\'s use of its own contractual clauses. If — which seems likely — the agency says such transfers are illegal, expect the legal mechanisms of other companies based in Ireland and across Europe to come under that same scrutiny. So at some point, those companies, too, could find themselves with little (if any) option to move information from the EU to the U.S.  — Next up on the calendar: Facebook\\'s judicial review case on Dublin\\'s likely ruling against the company\\'s standard contractual clauses is set for December 15. The court hearing will last up to four days; a judge\\'s decision is expected in early January.

TikTok decision: “The Trump administration ‘likely’ exceeded its legal authority with its order to ban TikTok downloads in the U.S. and impose other restrictions on the video-sharing platform, a federal judge wrote in a legal opinion disclosed Monday,” per Cristiano.  A message from Masterworks: History shows adding blue-chip art can boost portfolio stability. Data from Citi’s Global Art Market Report 2019 finds art to be one of the least volatile asset classes, sharing a correlation factor of just 0.13 to public equities. Beyond that, contemporary art has outperformed the S&P by over 180% from 2000–2018, according to industry benchmarks. Although investing in art has been around for centuries (Sotheby’s was once the oldest company listed on the NYSE) only the ultra-wealthy have been able to participate.

Indeed, even as Trump, too, talks in the direst tones about the consequences of a Biden victory, he doesn’t seem to have absorbed the message.  If the existence of the country itself is on the ballot in November, why not prepare better for the debates? Why not use Twitter exclusively for messages that advance his cause rather than detract from them? Why waste any time on petty animosities and distractions? Why not write down a health care plan and a Covid-19 plan to blunt Biden’s most potent issues?  Why not, in short, do at least a few things that are uncomfortable or un-natural in the cause of, you know, saving the country from imminent political destruction?  Of course, by this point, even asking the questions seem naive, although there were times in 2016 when Trump modulated his behavior enough to make a difference.  Prior to the first Trump-Biden debate, Ryan Lizza wrote a compelling piece for Politico looking back at the 2016 Trump-Hillary clashes and making the case that Trump was relatively disciplined and kept coming back to his central themes.  Last week’s debate last week was different. No doubt, Trump came in with a theory of the case—he wanted to steamroll Biden and make him crack. Nonetheless, the president gave in to his anger and contempt for Biden, and blew himself up in the course of trying to demolish the former Vice President. If Biden was calculatedly evasive and canned, Trump was profligate and underprepared—the way he almost always is.  As my colleague, Ramesh Ponnuru points out, in 2016 Trump fastened on issues that voters cared about more than the political elite did—trade and deindustrialization, immigration, and PC.  This time, he’s devoting inordinate time to matters that obsess him, not the average voter.  The sources of the Russia investigation should, as a matter of basic accountability, be established and disclosed. But no one who is not already a Trump voter cares about dubious investigatory decisions from four years ago.  Nor is anyone as exercised as the president about unfair things that might be said about him on cable TV programs.  Trump has waged a low-intensity campaign against masks, for no good reason. If masks and their more zealous advocates are annoying, they are also a low-cost, relatively easy intervention to diminish spread of the virus, and a popular one. By setting himself against masks, largely on aesthetic grounds, Trump further opened himself up to charges that he doesn’t take the virus seriously. Now, that case against him has even more political salience with his own illness and the White House outbreak.  Consider, on the other side of the ledger, how the economy is the top issue in the election and how Trump, by and large, leads on it. Still, there has been no sustained case that Biden’s program, including the largest tax increase in more than half a century, will hamper investment and growth. On what should be his foremost advantage, Trump has taken the famous James Carville adage and turned it on its head, “It’s everything else, stupid.”  If the time eventually comes for recriminations after a defeat in November (not a certainty, even at this late date), Trump’s hard-core supporters will have plenty of places to point—to a once-in-a-century pandemic, to an overwhelmingly hostile media, and to a poorly predicated special counsel investigation that ate up time and political capital, among other things.  Be all of that as it may, Trump won’t have been stabbed in the back; he will have committed a form of political hara-kiri because he found it easier and more enjoyable than exercising a modicum of self-discipline.  If Trump loses, the story isn’t going to be what was done to him, rather what he did to himself.'}\n",

Cedarburg is impossibly comfortable and categorically safe, its rates of crime and unemployment impossibly low, the sort of place where people leave front doors unlocked all day long. Downtown is straight out of Norman Rockwell’s daydreams, an elm-lined stretch of Americana where locals strut through morning power-walks and sip designer coffee and duck into boutique spice and wine stores. The only trouble in sight is a dog doing its business on an immaculate flowerbed.  This is a very different type of Trump Country from the one most commonly mythologized—just swap out the camouflage for cardigans, the flannels for Patagonia fleeces. In 2016, the president carried the WOW counties by yawning margins. Washington was decided by 40 points, Waukesha by 27. Ozaukee was the tightest of the three: 19 points, prompting whispers of a slow political realignment due north of Milwaukee.  While it’s true that Ozaukee is as Republican as any county in America—no Democratic presidential hopeful has cracked 40 percent of the vote in more than half a century—it’s also true that Trump has some unique problems here. The president won 56 percent of the vote in Ozaukee County but ran nearly 10 points behind GOP Senator Ron Johnson on the same ticket. It was a vivid display of the misgivings many Republicans had about Trump. Some split their ticket. Others voted for the Libertarian nominee. More than a few simply left the top of the ballot blank.  There is an opportunity here for Biden to break that 40 percent threshold, to take advantage of soft Republican support for the president. The bigger opportunity, however, belongs to Trump.  The 2020 election is shaping up as a clash of tribes—the ultimate binary choice on everything from politics to lifestyle to shared identity. With the electorate even more polarized now than it was in 2016, it’s difficult to imagine 7.2 percent of Ozaukee voters siding with a third-party candidate, as they did last time. If I’ve heard one thing from Americans over the past four years, in conversations from coast to coast, it’s that they feel forced to pick a team. Trump’s most essential task is to remind Republicans—especially in Wisconsin, without whose 10 electoral votes the president will struggle to win reelection—which side they’re really on.  This urgency for Trump echoes far beyond Ozaukee County. Although the suburbs in other swing states are more diverse—the communities around Detroit and Philadelphia bear little resemblance to those around Milwaukee—there are pockets of voters everywhere like those in Ozaukee. Identifying these people and persuading them to remain true to their Republican roots is Trump’s only chance to hold down his margins of defeat in metropolitan areas—which, in turn, may be his only chance of securing a second term.  You’ll know whether he’s successful by watching a place like Cedarburg. It voted in 2016 as a perfect representation of Ozaukee: 88 percent turnout (87 in the county), 55 percent for Trump (56 in the county), 37 percent for Clinton (37 in the county). Four years later, on a September afternoon in downtown, I talked with residents about the changes they see locally—the proliferation of partisan yard signs, the generational shift in attitudes toward racial justice, the one issue they prioritize above all others—and whether Cedarburg could symbolize Trump’s last stand.  “Unfortunately, we only have two real parties in this country, so our options are pretty limited,” said QUIANA VERBETEN, a 31-year-old mother of three. “I voted for Trump last time, but I cried. Literally—I cried while voting. I did not want to vote for him. But I decided I had to. And I actually feel better about him now.”  Why?  “Honestly, I’m pretty close to a one-issue voter. Abortion is the thing I care about most,” she said. “Trump is the only president to ever speak at the March for Life. That meant a lot to me.”  PETER VERBETEN, who works in software, let out a chuckle. “It’s funny, we actually disagree. I feel much worse about him now,” he mused. “But I’ll probably vote for him again, and for the same reason. The abortion issue, the conservative judges he’ll put in place—those things are going to last much longer than his presidency. I’m voting for those things. I’m not voting for Donald Trump.”  Quiana and Peter Verbeten shop in downtown Cedarburg. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO  Quiana, who trained as a hair stylist but now stays home with the couple’s daughters, said she and her husband are outliers among their peer group. “I’m of the belief that America’s values have been ground down for a long time, that our public schools have pushed an agenda on our kids, and that indoctrination has worked. We’re seeing that now,” she said. “Our generation has grown up with these values that have pushed them further to the left. They’ve got a different foundation from previous generations. That’s why we’re homeschooling our kids.”  Like nearly every person I met in Cedarburg, she spoke of a city 60 miles south: Kenosha. After the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, a mix of demonstrations—many peaceful, some violent—engulfed the city’s streets, bringing the summer of social unrest that much closer to home for the suburbanites of the WOW counties.  “It’s difficult to make sense of what’s happening right now,” Quiana said. “I’m pro-life, and I really do think that every life matters, so I want to support these causes. But I can’t support the organization Black Lives Matter because the organization itself is hateful. I’m all for peaceful protesting. And there needs to be real police reform. I’m just in that gray area. We want to support the police, but we also want to support people who are oppressed.”  JEFF MOSES wanted to talk it out.  “Look, I disagree with Trump on a lot of things. I’m for immigration. I’m for a lot of these social justice causes. I break with Trump on some pretty fundamental issues. But, on the other hand, I disagree with Democrats on a fundamental issue: abortion. And it’s hard for me to get over that. How can you advocate for social justice but approve of killing unborn babies? It makes no sense to me. So, what am I supposed to do?”  He thought for a long moment. “I don’t know. I’m really not sure if I can vote for Trump again. But I definitely don’t think I can vote for Biden.”  Moses, a 57-year-old investment analyst, was waiting outside the bank for his wife to complete a deposit. They live a short walk from downtown. Daisy, the family’s chocolate lab, moaned impatiently throughout our conversation. I asked Moses for his opinion on the Democratic Party. Under the watchful eye of his wife, LINDA MOSES, who had just emerged from the bank, Jeff measured his words.  Jeff and Linda Moses walk their dog, Daisy, in downtown Cedarburg. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO  “I am very, very concerned about what we’re seeing from the far left. And look, trust me, I know there are radicals on the right, too. But the media is so biased; they spend all their time on the right-wing radicals and give the left-wing radicals a pass. And honestly, that’s part of the reason I’ll probably wind up voting for Trump again. The media hates the people who voted for him last time, and they don’t bother understanding how they could possibly vote for him again.”  Linda frowned. “I have a slightly different view,” she said.  “This isn’t about the far left, or the radical right. This is about Donald Trump,” she continued. “I don’t trust him at all. People like that he’s not politically correct. Well, OK. But that doesn’t mean he’s trustworthy. I think he has no personal ethics whatsoever. None.”  Linda explained that she is a longtime Republican who, in 2016, voted for Hillary Clinton for president—and Ron Johnson for Senate. She plans to do the same thing this fall, splitting her ticket between Biden and congressional Republicans. She’s not excited about it. But she feels it’s her duty. “Biden is the lesser of two evils, just like Hillary was,” Linda said.  Does she still have a home in the Republican Party? “I don’t know. I’ve moved left a little bit,” she said. “But I’m not exactly a Democrat. I mean, I have strong feelings about certain things, like the environment and social justice. But, you know, we raised our kids Catholic, we instilled in them certain values. And I don’t believe Democrats represent some of those values, particularly when it comes to life. The abortion issue is a big problem for me.”  I asked them both whether Biden could break through in Ozaukee County this November, putting the area in play or at least substantially closing the historic gap between parties.  “There’s a big change occurring here. People want to get out of places like Chicagoland and Milwaukee and come up this way for the better schools, the safe communities, and really, with Covid, more space to work from home,” Jeff said.  A woman’s clothing store in downtown Cedarburg is adorned with Black Lives Matter signs. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO  “Yes, and there’s a much bigger movement against Trump now,” she said. “There’s much more diversity, at least diversity of thought, in this community and in the surrounding areas. And I know some people would disagree, but my personal feeling is that the Black Lives Matter movement helps Biden’s cause here. It really highlights how people are afraid of this white supremacist movement gaining stream—and how Trump seems to be a part of it.”  Jeff grimaced. “The white supremacist people are nuts, no doubt about it, they’re causing violence and they need to be put away,” he said. “But when you look at these riots in Kenosha—burning down blocks of small businesses, that’s not peaceful protest. I’m telling you, it’s changing peoples’ minds about how they view the racial justice movement. We don’t want chaos and destruction. That’s not peaceful protest. That’s not what Dr. King was about. And when you see it happen in Kenosha, it scares you.”  In the picture-book atmosphere of downtown Cedarburg, only one thing appeared out of place: DAVE BREIDENBACH.  The 68-year-old retired salesman stood in front of a local storefront holding a sign: “Pray to End Abortion.” His silver Ford SUV, parked a few feet away, was plastered with similar pro-life signage. Against the placid backdrop of his hometown, Breidenbach stood out—not just for his scruffy white beard and red MAGA cap, but for his willingness to stir the pot politically. I had noticed, since arriving in Cedarburg, the remarkable reluctance of locals to speak on the record. Never in the past year had I encountered so many people unwilling to put their names to statements. I chalked this up to a general tendency I’ve noticed throughout my career, that wealthy white people are the most averse when it comes to discussing their politics.  Breidenbach, who stood courting conversation (and sometimes, he admitted, confrontation) on the corner of Washington Avenue and Turner Street, offered a more urgent explanation.  “These people are timid. They don’t want to get harassed. They don’t want to ruffle any feathers,” he said. “Cedarburg is conservative but lackadaisical. These people don’t realize that it could happen here.”'}\n",

Barrett will begin meeting with senators on Tuesday, although some Dems, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are refusing to meet with her in protest of her election-year nomination.  And White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that \"if all goes well\", the Senate will fill the vacancy before the November election. That would make it an unprecedented confirmation, as no SCOTUS nominee has ever been confirmed that close to a presidential election.  Here’s the SCOTUS Judiciary hearing schedule, per Burgess:  —Monday, 10/12: Opening statements  —Tuesday, 10/13: First round of questions  —Wednesday, 10/14: Second round of questions and closed session  —Thursday, 10/15: Outside witnesses  —Thursday, 10/22: Report the nominee out of committee  SO, what are the chances that Barrett makes it over the finish line? Pretty high, according to congressional Republicans. She has rock solid support on the right, especially among conservatives and anti-abortion activists. And she’s battle-tested, having already been through the Senate’s confirmation process for her current judgeship.  Of course, Dems will try to land some blows during her high-profile confirmation hearing. And the Senate GOP is working with a slim 53-seat majority. But barring some kind of bombshell or unforeseen roadblock, the feeling among Senate Republicans is that Barrett’s confirmation is all but certain. More on this from Burgess: https://politi.co/337BYLn .  In fact … “President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell are so confident they\\'ll confirm Barrett that they\\'re already thinking about who to tap to replace her on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, based in Chicago,” reports Axios’ Alayna Treene .

DEMS STAY DISCIPLINED -- In reacting to Trump\\'s SCOTUS pick, Dems made clear what their messaging strategy is going to be: make it all about health care. In tweets, statements and Sunday news show appearances, Democrats across the board warned Americans that their health care and the popular protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake if Barrett is confirmed, pointing to the Obamacare lawsuit that will come before the Supreme Court in mid-November.  Schumer even sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues urging them to stay focused on health care and the potential demise of the Affordable Care Act. “All the data show that with COVID raging, the number one priority for the American people is health care — its affordability, accessibility and quality,” Schumer wrote in the Dear Colleague note. “We must focus like a laser on health care because Judge Barrett’s record is so clear on this issue.” The deets from Burgess: https://politi.co/30bTEUj .  Trump, meanwhile, is also apparently making it about health care. “Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA!” Trump tweeted, which only handed fresh ammo to Democrats.

MUCK IT UP -- As we’ve said before, Senate Democrats can’t derail Trump’s nominee if Mitch McConnell has the votes. And they can’t even slow it down much, either. Here’s what Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday: “We could slow it down perhaps a matter of hours, maybe days at the most, but we can’t stop the outcome,” he said. “What we should do is to address this now respectfully.”  But Democrats *can* make life a little more miserable for Republicans — especially the vulnerable GOP lawmakers who are up for reelection and are itching to hit the campaign trail. Here are some of the procedural weapons that Dems could use to obstruct Republicans, per Andrew:  —Invoke the two-hour rule  —Object to going on recess  —Deny Republicans a quorum  —Force roll-call votes on points of order and motions to adjourn  The full story: https://politi.co/335pnrU .

HAPPY MONDAY! Welcome to Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this September 28, where your host knows there’s no use crying over spilled milk — but can we make an exception for an entire tank of spilled wine? !  MONDAY’S MOST CLICKED: IB Times’ story on Sen. Lindsey Graham pleading for campaign cash on Fox News drew the most clicks.  THE 2020 PLOT TWIST YOU DIDN’T KNOW YOU NEEDED -- How can 2020 get any crazier, you ask? Well, a deadlocked Electoral College could force the House to step in and determine the fate of the presidency — a once-in-a-century phenomenon that has only happened a few times in history. And both Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have begun to seriously consider the possibility of the election fight coming to Congress. Pelosi has privately raised the idea to her leadership team and even sent out a “Dear Colleague” letter yesterday emphasizing how important it is for Democrats to win House state delegations.  Bres, Kyle and Heather explain more: “Under that scenario, which hasn’t happened since 1876, every state’s delegation gets a single vote. Who receives that vote is determined by an internal tally of each lawmaker in the delegation. This means the presidency may not be decided by the party that controls the House itself but by the one that controls more state delegations in the chamber. And right now, Republicans control 26 delegations to Democrats’ 22, with Pennsylvania tied and Michigan a 7-6 plurality for Democrats, with a 14th seat held by independent Justin Amash.  “A battle inside the House could be brutal, even more politically bare-knuckled than Trump and Senate Republicans pushing through a Supreme Court nominee days before the election. In some states, a single seat could decide the partisan makeup of a delegation. There could be extended legal challenges over declaring victors in House races, as national party leaders and their legal teams dive headlong into the results for individual races at the county or even precinct level.” The story: https://politi.co/3mSRQJD .  In other House congressional race news: “In Colorado, Fiery Political Novice Aims for a Seat in the House,” by NYT’s Carl Hulse: https://nyti.ms/3mWFQqk .  SIGNS OF LIFE? -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone Friday about a potential coronavirus relief deal, per Pelosi’s aide Drew Hammill. And Pelosi told CNN’s Jake Tapper that she still believes “we can come to an agreement” and “I\\'m hoping for a deal.” She also acknowledged that House Dems may offer up their own bill on the floor this week, but said she would “rather have a deal which puts money in people’s pockets than to have a rhetorical argument.”  But Pelosi also emphasized that Dems have already come down significantly on their offer — their latest package is expected to cost around $2.4 trillion — and made clear she’s not interested in coming down any further. “But if they do not want to go to that place, if they’re not going to meet the needs of the American people, if they’re not ready to do what is necessary to crush the virus, to honor our heroes, our health care workers, our teachers, our transportation, sanitation, first responders, police and fire, if they don’t want to recognize that these people are risking their lives to save lives, and now they will lose their jobs, to the tune of millions of people … and then go on unemployment insurance, is that smart? I don\\'t think so.”  Notable … The House floor schedule this week includes the “Possible Consideration of Legislation Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic.”  Related read: “Centrist Democrats got their COVID bill, now they want a vote,” by The Hill’s Mike Lillis and Scott Wong: https://bit.ly/30eQxuS .  RETURN OF THE TAX RETURNS -- The New York Times dropped a bombshell yesterday, unveiling two decades worth of Trump’s tax returns and promising to publish a series of stories over the next few weeks. The big takeaway from the first piece — titled “Long-Concealed Records Show Trump\\'s Chronic Losses and Years of Income Tax Avoidance” — is that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016, and zero dollars in 10 of the 15 years prior.  House Democrats, of course, have been trying to get their hands on Trump’s tax returns for a while, but the lawsuit is tied up in court. Here’s the statement from House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal: “Now, Donald Trump is the boss of the agency he considers an adversary. It is essential that the IRS’s presidential audit program remain free of interference. Today’s report underscores the importance of the Ways and Means Committee’s ongoing lawsuit to access Mr. Trump’s tax returns and ensure the presidential audit program is functioning effectively, without improper influence.”  FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS -- “Back from brink of death, Mark DeSaulnier is ready to work and run again,” via Tal Kopan of the San Francisco Chronicle: https://bit.ly/2GgxngZ .  I MADE IT NICE -- In another sign that the Senate GOP majority is in jeopardy this November, the historically right-leaning Chamber of Commerce is now planning to make nice with Senate Dems. The dispatch from Alex Isenstadt: “Jack Howard, the Chamber’s senior vice president of congressional and public affairs, announced during a Friday morning staff video conference that the organization would be engaging in an ‘all-hands-on-deck … serious, sustained’ effort to ‘normalize our relationships’ with Senate Democrats, according to a clip of the meeting obtained by POLITICO.  “The remarks come with Democrats leading Republican senators in the polls in several key states — and with the pro-business, traditionally conservative Chamber facing a precarious moment. The group has clashed with President Donald Trump on issues including trade and immigration and is now facing an internal revolt over its decision to endorse a slate of vulnerable freshmen House Democrats for reelection. The move represented a major shift for the Chamber, which has long endorsed and funded Republican candidates and backed few Democrats in recent years.” More: https://politi.co/3mULFVg .

Quick Fix  SENATE OUT UNTIL OCT. 19: The full Senate will return two weeks later than scheduled after Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) tested positive for the coronavirus, our Congress team reports. The announcement came as President Donald Trump, who tested positive for Covid-19 last Friday, was spending the weekend at Walter Reed Medical Center just north of Washington.  But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the change of plans won’t stop the Senate from moving forward with Amy Coney Barrett\\'s Supreme Court nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee is still set to begin confirmation hearings on Oct. 12.  The delay will interrupt the Senate’s other business. Last week, the Senate Homeland Security Committee advanced Chad Wolf’s nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security permanently, meaning he now awaits a full Senate vote. And since McConnell had filed cloture on a handful of judicial nominees before the Senate pushed back its schedule, it’s even more unclear when Wolf will be up next.  And the outbreak “has added another layer of chaos to already tumultuous negotiations over renewing aid for airline workers,” our Stephanie Beasley reports, throwing into doubt whether any relief could be passed soon. On Friday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi promised that airline aid will be enacted one way or another, whether as part of a larger package or as a standalone bill.  House members are on call to head back to D.C. as soon as a deal is reached, but even if an aid bill passes the House, the Senate\\'s planned recess raises questions about its fate. A spokesperson for McConnell declined to comment on whether Senate members would consider voting on airline aid prior to Oct. 19.  Complicating matters, three more Republican senators have said they are quarantining, narrowing the GOP’s 53-member majority. And don’t forget, Senate rules stipulate that Senators need to be in Washington in order to cast their votes.  GOOD MORNING.

Driving the Day  CDC OFFICIALS FOUGHT TRUMP BORDER POLICY: Senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention objected to a March order the CDC issued that permitted border agents “to immediately return to Mexico any migrants they encountered crossing the border, citing the threat of the coronavirus,” Michelle Hackman, Andrew Restuccia and Stephanie Armour report for The Wall Street Journal.  “White House officials said at the time the order was driven by the advice of public-health experts and was solely a pandemic-related safety precaution intended to prevent Covid-19 from spreading through cramped and unsanitary Border Patrol stations, where migrants arrested at the border would be crowded together.”  But Hackman, Restuccia and Armour found “the policy was driven by immigration officials in the administration over the objections of senior officials at the CDC, the agency with the authority to issue the order, who warned the rationale behind enacting the pandemic policy was an inappropriate use of its public-health powers.”  “The policy achieves a longstanding goal that Trump administration officials have publicly discussed to discourage or prevent migrants at the southern border from making claims for asylum, which they believe are often meritless,” they write.  Business Relief  REGAL MAY SHUTTER ALL LOCATIONS: “The second-largest cinema chain in America is likely to close indefinitely all its U.S. locations, after reopening in August,” R.T. Watson reports for The Wall Street Journal. Regal Cinemas’ “potential decision to suspend operations at its more than 500 locations follows a cascade of postponements for big-budget Hollywood films, most recently the coming James Bond title ‘No Time to Die.’” A final decision isn’t expected until this week.  An employee cleans the seats in preparation for reopening at a Regal move theater in Irvine, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2020. | AP Photo/Jae C. Hong  MORE TROUBLE FOR THEATERS? “The string of delays casts a shadow over the remainder of 2020’s movie calendar and potentially over the entire theatrical industry,” Watson writes. “Last week, a cinema owners’ trade group joined leading filmmakers in sending a letter to lawmakers in the hopes of drumming up financial relief for the ailing sector.”  “If the status quo continues, 69% of small and midsize movie theater companies will be forced to file for bankruptcy or to close permanently,” the National Association of Theatre Owners said in a written statement.  MORE ON THAT AIRLINE AID: Pelosi on Friday asked airline executives directly to hold off on massive job cuts, promising that Congress would deliver “imminent” relief, our Sarah Ferris, Tanya Snyder and Sam Mintz report.  BACKGROUND: “The U.S. airline industry is at a crisis point, with thousands of furloughs and layoffs going into effect Thursday after Congress failed to renew a pandemic aid program for aviation workers.” Airlines had agreed to reverse those job cuts if Pelosi and Secretary Steven Mnuchin could reach a deal in the next few days, but as of Sunday they remain far apart on key issues.  “The airline aid, which would cost roughly $28 billion, has broad bipartisan support, but has been unable to win approval from Congress amid more contentious disputes over coronavirus relief,” Sarah, Sam and Tanya write.  ALSO: “Mnuchin: Administration will simplify small business loan forgiveness,” from our Zachary Warmbrodt  Unions  FLRA LIMITS FEDERAL BARGAINING RIGHTS: The Federal Labor Relations Authority issued a trio of decisions last week that make it harder for federal employee unions to negotiate on issues not brought up during formal contract negotiations, Erich Wagner reports for Government Executive.  The first decision raised the standard for whether an agency policy change “triggers a duty to bargain” over its implementation. The second found that federal labor law “neither requires nor prohibits midterm bargaining” and “makes zipper clauses, which limit negotiations during the term of a union contract, mandatory subjects of bargaining,” according to Wagner.  The last decision, he writes, “states that when an expiring union contract is renewed indefinitely while parties negotiate on a new contract, that is effectively a new agreement that is subject to agency head review and implementation of new governmentwide rules and regulations.”  MORE: “Judge declines to stop rule requiring Michigan state employees to OK union dues annually,” from The Detroit News  Economy  ICYMI — SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT: The unemployment rate dropped last month by half a percentage point to 7.9 percent.  Some 661,000 jobs were added last month. That figure would normally would be great, but it was lower than expectations. The economy is still playing catch-up; it’s 10 million jobs short of restoring the 22 million jobs lost to the Covid-19 pandemic. More from our Ben White.  And state and local governments shed 184,000 jobs in September, our Kellie Mejdrich reports, “ending a brief recovery during the summer” and suggesting “that their economic pain is deepening as Congress fails to reach a deal on an economic-relief package.”  REPEATING HISTORY? “During the last recession, governments — mostly state and local — shed about 750,000 jobs over five years. This time around, approximately 1.5 million jobs had been lost since the pandemic hit, as of June,” Kellie writes.  CUTS AHEAD: Democrats, governors and labor groups have been calling for more aid for state budgets decimated by steep revenue drop-offs because of the pandemic. “Otherwise, they warn, more cuts are coming to essential services like education, health care and public safety that local economies need now more than ever,” Kellie adds.  Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the House Republican leadership and a senior appropriator, told POLITICO that if lawmakers fail to reach agreement soon, the economy could “lose the momentum that we created over the summer.\"  What We\\'re Reading  — “At least a quarter of Disney layoffs coming from Florida,” from The Associated Press  — “Fired Warner Bros. marketing executive sues studio over discrimination, ‘boys club’ culture,” from The Los Angeles Times  — “Many in migrant caravan bused back to Honduran border,” from The Associated Press  — “Workers Face Permanent Job Losses as the Virus Persists,” from The New York Times  — “Lengthy era of rock-bottom interest rates leaving its mark on U.S. economy,” from The Washington Post  — “Pope: Market capitalism has failed in pandemic, needs reform,” from The Associated Press  — “Geneva adopts what\\'s believed to be the highest minimum wage in the world, at $25 an hour,” from CNN  THAT’S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT!

At the top of the agenda, unsurprisingly, would be another coronavirus relief package. “A stimulus package prior to the November election is highly unlikely, and barring a major winter resurgence of the virus coupled with a spike in business closures and unemployment, a lame duck stimulus bill is also an uphill climb,” the firm writes in one memo. Exactly what Biden proposes “will depend on the public health and economic outlook,” the firm continues. “If unemployment rates continue to fall and infection rates do not worsen during the winter, a smaller, more targeted package is likely.”  — The memo also lays out what Biden might do on health care, taxes, education, financial services, the minimum wage, trade, energy and the environment, among other policy areas. A second memo outlines what Biden might do on taxes if Democrats retake the Senate. And a third memo — which the firm admits is “highly speculative” — offers guidance on what many lobbyists’ clients really want to know: who Biden is likely to tap to staff his White House and fill his cabinet if he wins.  — Here are some of the names the firm mentions: Ron Klain or Steve Ricchetti for White House chief of staff; Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken or Robert Malley for national security adviser; Jared Bernstein, Heather Boushey or Jason Furman as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Lael Brainard, Sarah Bloom Raskin or Larry Summers as chairman of the National Economic Council. (Summers said last month that he wouldn’t join a Biden administration, for what it’s worth.)  — More names: Susan Rice, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) or Blinken for secretary of State; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jamie Dimon, Richard Cordray or Neel Kashkari for Treasury secretary; Michèle Flournoy or Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) for Defense secretary; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); Preet Bharara, Stacey Abrams or Sally Yates for attorney general; Reps. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) or Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) for Interior secretary; Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman for Agriculture secretary; Rohit Chopra or Susan Helper for Commerce secretary; William Spriggs or Sharon Block as Labor secretary; and Ezekiel Emanuel, Andy Slavitt, Vivek Murthy; former Delaware Gov.

He’ll lobby on real estate issues and coronavirus-related liability issues for the private equity giant, he said in an interview. Neihardt was an in-house lobbyist for Hilton, in which Blackstone held a stake for more than a decade, before leaving to start his own firm earlier this year. Blackstone hired PricewaterhouseCoopers over the summer to lobby on the taxation of real estate investment trusts and also retains half a dozen other outside lobbying firms, according to disclosure filings.  TWITTER RESHUFFLES WASHINGTON OFFICE: “Twitter's public policy director, Carlos Monje, has left the social media company's Washington office to join the transition team for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a person familiar with the move said Thursday, POLITICO’s Steven Overly reports. The company has also beefed up its Washington office with several new hires and promoted Lauren Culbertson, who’s been with Twitter since 2017, “to the head of U.S. public policy. Culbertson started her own consulting business prior to joining Twitter and previously served as deputy communications director for former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).”  — Joining her are Amy Murphy, a former Internet Association lobbyist, who “will focus on privacy and internet liability law”; Todd O’Boyle, who left Lime “to handle Twitter’s policies related to elections, the census, violent extremism and immigration”; and Wifredo Fernandez, who “will help manage federal and state advocacy after working as a legal fellow at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.”  ANNALS OF CONGRESSIONAL SIDE GIGS: Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) “has broken with the scientific mainstream during the coronavirus pandemic — decrying stay-at-home orders and warning of a ‘cult of masks.’” Now Harris, who’s also a medical doctor, “has joined the hunt for coronavirus treatments with an unpaid side gig overseeing a drug company trial,” POLITICO’s Zachary Brennan reports. “Harris is one of three members of the data and safety monitoring board for the trial run by NeuroRx, a small Delaware company whose CEO and founder has longstanding ties to the congressman.”  — “The members of the board are responsible for monitoring safety and efficacy data from the ongoing trial, which started in May, and have the power to end the study if problems arise. The drug in question, aviptadil, was created in 1970 to treat lung inflammation, but never reached the market. NeuroRx is now investigating whether it can help Covid-19 patients with acute lung failure. Harris’s role is an unusual one: Former [Food and Drug Administration] Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told POLITICO that he’d never heard of a sitting member of Congress serving on a data monitoring committee for any drug.”  — “The arrangement doesn’t appear to run afoul of House ethics rules because Harris is not being paid by NeuroRx and does not own a stake in the company. But several bioethicists questioned his lack of experience in evaluating data from drug trials, and said that his close ties to NeuroRx CEO Jonathan Javitt could complicate matters if problems arose with the company’s study.”  GRAHAM RAISED MONEY FROM PODESTA GROUP BEFORE BASHING IT: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been running TV ads for the past month “criticizing his Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison for working for the Podesta Group,” the Washington lobbying firm that collapsed in 2017. But Graham hasn’t always been opposed to the firm, The Post and Courier’s Jamie Lovegrove reports. “During Graham’s last reelection campaign, the South Carolina Republican held a fundraiser with more than a dozen Podesta Group lobbyists at a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by the firm’s co-founder, Tony Podesta, according to an invitation obtained by The Post and Courier.”  — “Attendance at the April 11, 2013, breakfast fundraiser cost $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for political action committees, according to the invitation. Federal disclosures show Graham raised more than $14,000 from Podesta Group lobbyists over the course of his 2014 campaign.”  Jobs Report  — Sirona Strategies has hired Kevin Farrelly as a senior director and Casey Osgood as a director.

Driving the Day  CORONAVIRUS LOANS MISUSED, DOJ SAYS: The DOJ has targeted more than 40 individuals for crimes related to fraudulent applications for government-backed small business loans “that were intended to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic,” our Kellie Mejdrich reports.  The fraud represents a drop in the bucket, considering the two Small Business Administration\\'s programs — the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program — have doled out hundreds of billions, and the DOJ cases so far only amount to some $170 million. But taxpayer advocates say the cases underscore the need for more transparency and that the amount of data released by the government is unacceptable — even as Congress considers whether to make it easier for PPP loans of less than $150,000 to be forgiven and to throw more money at the program.  The SBA inspector general\\'s office says it has “initiated hundreds of cases involving potential fraud\" in the two programs, Kellie reports. The alleged fraudsters stand accused of using money meant for payroll instead to “finance such extravagances as luxury cars, Vegas gambling trips and nights on the town at strip clubs.”  RELATED: “JPMorgan Probing Employees’ Role in Misuse of Relief Funds,” from Bloomberg  COVID-19 IN THE FIELDS: The nation’s 2.5 million farmworkers — about half of whom the government estimates are undocumented — are critical to keeping the food system working, but have gotten little federal help to protect themselves from the coronavirus, our Helena Bottemiller Evich, Ximena Bustillo and Liz Crampton report.  Orchard worker Francisco Hernandez reaches to pull honey crisp apples off the vine during a thinning of the trees at an orchard in Yakima, Wash. on June 16, 2020. | AP Photo/Elaine Thompson  “For several weeks,” they write, “many of the places that grow the nation’s fruits and vegetables have seen disproportionately high rates of coronavirus cases — a national trend that, as harvest season advances in many states, threatens already vulnerable farmworkers, their communities and the places they work.”  Health departments are not collecting data on how many individual farmworkers have tested positive or been hospitalized or killed by the coronavirus. “The Food and Environment Reporting Network estimates that at least 57,000 food system workers, including 6,700 farmworkers, have tested positive for Covid-19 nationally, but that’s just a partial snapshot because testing is limited,” Helena, Ximena and Liz write.  AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL… The Trump administration has repeatedly declined to impose mandatory safety requirements for any workplace. And the federal government has not designated any pandemic aid to help farmers obtain personal protective gear for their laborers, unlike other essential workers like nurses and police officers.  “Trump’s silence on the immigration status of farmworkers, critics say, is one of political convenience as farmers, a rock-solid part of the president’s base, freely admit there’s simply no way to harvest the country’s crops without help from foreign workers, whether they live in the U.S. without legal status or come in for several months on a work visa.”  On the Hill  SENATE SKINNY BILL UPDATE: Senate Republicans introduced S. 178 Tuesday in an effort to prod Democrats forward on another round of pandemic aid, following weeks of disagreement over how much Congress should bolster the pandemic-battered economy, our Marianne LeVine and John Bresnahan report.  The GOP hasn’t tallied whether it has enough votes to pass the bill, but is tentatively planning to vote on the measure Thursday, they write.  WHAT’S IN IT: “The new, more narrow GOP proposal will provide $300 in increased weekly federal unemployment benefits through Dec. 27, additional money for the Paycheck Protection Program and liability protections for schools and businesses as they try to reopen,” the pair report. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 billion, but the measure also proposes rescinding hundreds of billions in previously appropriated funds to hold down the costs.  WHAT’S NOT: The $1,200 stimulus checks supported by President Donald Trump and members of the GOP. (h/t to WaPo’s Jeff Stein)  ‘HEADED NOWHERE’: Democratic leaders and the White House have been at a stalemate for several weeks over the next round of pandemic aid, and Congress is only in session for a few weeks before members go home to campaign.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have already panned the GOP proposal as “emaciated,” issuing a statement that the bill is “headed nowhere.”  Economy  COVID-19 RECESSION WORSENS WEALTH GAP: The coronavirus-induced recession has widened an already dramatic wealth gap in the U.S., as wealthier Americans continue to earn and save at record levels while the poorest struggle to pay their bills and nearly 30 million rely on unemployment benefits, our Megan Cassella reports.  2020 VISION: The growing divide could also hit Trump\\'s reelection bid, Megan Cassella writes, as Trump\\'s base of working-class, blue-collar voters in the Midwest are another demographic that’s taken a serious hit. And though Trump has campaigned on his ability to reignite the U.S. economy, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that nearly 60 percent of people think the economy is on the wrong track.  MORE: “In Battleground Pennsylvania, Blue- and White-Collar Voters Move Farther Apart,” from The Wall Street Journal  In the Workplace  AUDIT FINDS DC METRO CREATES HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT: A recent audit into the District of Columbia’s subway operations center found the workplace created a “toxic” environment where employees “are bullied, racially and sexually harassed, and told by managers to ignore authorities and operating procedures,” Justin George reports for The Washington Post.  The 50-page report points out “deep cultural, communication and organizational flaws in the agency’s Rail Operations Control Center,” raising questions about Metrorail safety for both employees and passengers.  WHAT NOW? “Metro has 45 days to begin addressing more than 20 safety and structural findings identified by the commission, an independent panel created by Congress to oversee Metro safety after the previous oversight panel was found to be ineffective,” George writes.  Regulatory Corner  DOL TO WEIGH IN ON GIG WORKER DEBATE: The White House budget office is reviewing a DOL proposed rule that would clarify whether a worker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor. OMB began review of the regulation on Aug. 28, the first step before the proposal is published publicly.  The question could have huge ramifications for the gig economy, as workers for apps like Uber, Lyft and Doordash are generally classified as independent contractors who aren’t protected under federal minimum wage and overtime laws. A source briefed directly on the situation confirmed to Morning Shift that DOL leadership wouldn’t have included it on the regulatory agenda if it didn’t think it could finalize the rule this year.  BUT… Such a rule could be threatened next Congress if Democrats were to win the White House and take control of Congress in the fall. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can use a fast-track procedure to overturn a regulation issued within the prior 60 legislative days via simple majority votes.  FEDERAL COURT VOIDS PARTS OF DOL JOINT EMPLOYER RULE: A federal court on Tuesday invalidated several parts of the Trump administration’s joint employer rule. Southern District of New York federal judge Gregory Woods found the rule was “arbitrary and capricious” and that the DOL’s interpretation of who counts as a joint employer conflicted with the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act.  The rule, issued in January, set up a more stringent legal test that made it harder for businesses to be on the hook as a “joint employer” when their franchisees or contractors violate federal wage and overtime laws. The rulemaking marked a reversal from the Obama administration, which said a business with indirect control over employees could be held jointly liable, a looser standard that made it easier to classify companies as joint employers.  Specifically, the opinion vacates the Trump administration test for what is known as “vertical” joint employer liability. Vertical joint employment is more common, and occurs when an individual is employed by a contractor or staffing agency, but relies on the work provided by another business who has contracted them. The opinion and order.

Although she signed on to a controversial opinion upholding the Florida Legislature’s insistence that would-be voters with felony records pay fines as a prerequisite to voting, her brief record on the federal bench left her views on hot-button issues pretty opaque. In that posture, Lagoa would not have served as a severe splitter, a divider or a source of deep existential agony for millions of Americans.  Barrett, like Justice Brett Kavanaugh before her, may well be a delightful person. And while her professed devotion to a theory of interpretation called “originalism” puts her solidly in the camp of conservative jurists, Lagoa is of that ilk, too. The difference is that Barrett’s views on contentious issues like abortion, Obamacare, gun rights, sexual assault and immigration are well-documented and lean decidedly against majorities of the voting public. Her nomination is thus a political act of splitting. It is yet one more Trumpian assault on “We the People” of a democratic republic composed of many different views, beliefs and needs. And sadly, in the wake of Justice Ginsburg’s legacy of moderation and grace, pushing Barrett through a Republican-only Senate vote just days before an election that will determine the fate of American democracy is more fuel for the fires of hatred, extreme fear and violence. It does not bode well. She is the wrong choice for America right now.  ‘Once again, the court will be a conservative bulwark against democratic forces’  Howard Gillman is chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, and the co-author of The Religion Clauses: The Case for Separating Church and State .  For most of the nation’s history, the Supreme Court was a protector of the rights and interests of America’s elites against larger democratic forces. Its focus was the protection of property rights, corporate rights, slave owner rights and limits on the ability of legislatures to regulate. It struck down income taxes, child labor laws, minimum wage laws and civil rights legislation. It did very little to protect the rights and interests of those struggling for greater equality and opportunity. It prevented democratic majorities from advancing progressive agendas. It tried mightily to prevent the New Deal. In short, it was a conservative bulwark.  This legacy started to change in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of a bipartisan agreement among presidents and senators that courts should be more supportive of civil rights, civil liberties, the circumstances of “discrete and insular minorities,” and the ability of government to address contemporary social challenges. Many of us who grew up during this period took for granted that the Supreme Court would be a force for protecting the vulnerable rather than the powerful. But no longer.  With the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett — an undoubtedly qualified jurist with rock-solid conservative credentials — the court will revert to the role it performed for most of our history, with an ironclad majority of conservative justices who have dedicated their careers to taking back the courts. As a result, Congress’ authority to address national challenges, including access to health care and the promotion of civil rights, will be diminished, regulatory agencies will work less in the interests of average people, voting rights will receive less protection, state and local governments will be allowed to align themselves more with majority religious sects, the interests of powerful religious groups will be privileged over hard-won protections for the LGBTQ-plus community, and women’s reproductive rights will be at the mercy of state legislatures. Joining her in the new majority are other justices who were appointed by Republican presidents who did not win a majority of the popular vote, at a time when Democratic president candidates have won a majority or plurality of the popular vote in seven of the past eight elections. In short, once again, the court will be a conservative bulwark against democratic forces.  ‘She will likely move the Supreme Court in a principled direction’  Ilya Shapiro is director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Rights at the Cato Institute and author of Supreme Disorder: Judicial Nominations and the Politics of America’s Highest Court .  Judge Amy Coney Barrett has displayed a seriousness of purpose and is dedicated to finding and applying the Constitution’s original public meaning. Her thoughtful opinions and academic writings show a willingness to hold government officials’ feet to the constitutional fire, although one law review article gives me pause about potential over-deference to state authority regarding the sorts of regulations and restrictions that have come to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have no doubt she is qualified to be a justice and that she will bring esteem to the Supreme Court.  As Justice Barrett, she will likely move the Supreme Court in a principled direction, as there would no longer be a need to account for Chief Justice John Roberts’ strategery to achieve a majority. I look forward to the court’s finally starting to flesh out the scope of the right to keep and bear arms, to putting an end to treating people differently based on the color of their skin and to reining in the federal government’s overreach in a host of areas. While Barrett isn’t known for her administrative law opinions, I would hope also that she will join fellow Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in reining in the bureaucracy, forcing Congress to make the tough decisions about conflicting policy views. That’s ultimately the only way we’ll start dissipating the toxic cloud surrounding judicial nominations.  Kavanaugh is now the swing justice when it comes to abortion  Mary Ziegler is a professor at Florida State University College of Law and author, most recently of Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present .  Amy Coney Barrett seems likely to shape the court’s jurisprudence for decades to come — not least when it comes to abortion. The court already had a conservative majority, but Chief Justice John Roberts’ concern for the court’s appearance seemingly made him reluctant to dismantle abortion rights too quickly. Barrett’s ascent likely gives the deciding vote on abortion to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a judge whose name still almost immediately brings to mind the #MeToo movement. Kavanaugh, like Roberts, is not likely to give conservatives instant gratification when it comes to abortion. But his professed respect for precedent has not so far stopped him from rolling back abortion rights. He seemed to think that abortion foes could distinguish identical Louisiana and Texas laws, all while claiming to respect precedent. Kavanaugh understands that the court’s undue-burden test provides a perfect vehicle for undermining abortion rights. There is no reason to expect that will change if Barrett becomes the high court’s sixth conservative member.  Barrett may also help to form part of a more clearly — and unapologetically — conservative wing. Justice Clarence Thomas is fond of fiery dissents and concurrences, but he often finds no one to join him. Barrett firms up the court’s conservative majority — creating a sort of insurance policy for the right if the chief justice or one of his colleagues breaks away from the pack. And Barrett’s confirmation might make more of the justices comfortable joining Thomas in demanding radical changes to many areas of the law.  A foolproof conservative majority, with Barrett at its heart, might come at a real cost to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. If, as widely expected, Joe Biden wins the popular vote, Democrats will have carried a public majority in seven of the past eight presidential elections. In the same period, the court has become ever more conservative, and likely to contravene policies that voters prefer. Roberts has long had a fear of backlash — the kind of political crisis that can plague the court when it departs too far from public opinion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump might not care about what becomes of the court as an institution, but members of the court’s new conservative supermajority would be wise to recognize that the chief justice has reason to be concerned about the court’s reputation. When it comes to abortion, or to the fate of Obamacare, everyone is watching. The fate of the judicial branch’s legitimacy might just hang in the balance.  ‘We may be looking at the last new Roberts Court’  Josh Blackman is a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and the co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know .  For the past 15 years, the Supreme Court has been known as the Roberts Court. But in truth, each new justice forms a new court. Chief Justice Roberts has presided over numerous personnel changes. Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, David Souter, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg left, and Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have arrived. By Election Day, the chief justice will likely welcome Justice Amy Coney Barrett as the ninth member of the court. And a new Roberts Court will begin.  The confirmation process for Justice Barrett will be excruciatingly painful. Yet, it will still be familiar — a process that we know, with a predictable outcome. The future of the court, on the other hand, is far more uncertain. In 2021, or perhaps 2025, Democrats will likely push to expand the court. Roberts may soon have to greet two or more new members, even though there were no departures. The chief may go through all the same formalities, welcoming No. 10 and 11 the same way he welcomed No. 9 — but the Supreme Court will never be the same. We may be looking at the last new Roberts Court.  ‘She has not been and will not be subject to a level of vetting appropriate to a lifetime appointment’  Jamal Greene is a professor at Columbia Law School and the author of the forthcoming book How Rights Went Wrong: Why Our Obsession with Rights Is Tearing America Apart .  Judge Barrett seems to be a smart lawyer and a decent person. But the fact is we can’t intelligently predict what her selection will mean for the court or for the country because she has not been and will not be subject to a level of vetting appropriate to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. What we do know is that the woman whose seat she is seeking to fill lived a life committed not just to equality — what she often called “equal citizenship stature” for all — but to values of thoughtfulness and due process. To allow just two weeks to prepare for a hearing and vote, on the eve of a presidential election, dishonors her legacy.  A role model for women  Helen Alvaré is a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School and the co-author of the forthcoming book Christianity and the Laws of Conscience .  Amy Coney Barrett will inspire several generations of female lawyers and academics for many of the same reasons Ruth Bader Ginsburg did. Her intellectual excellence and her dedication throughout decades to the unrelenting and high-stakes work of lawyering, writing, teaching and judging make her a role model for lawyers generally.  Realistically, though, female attorneys are still prone to asking themselves again and again whether they can “do justice” to both their work and their personal responsibilities. For these women, Judge Barrett’s example, like Justice Ginsburg’s, will be a touchstone for many years.  ‘To talk about what Amy Coney Barrett would mean for this issue or that issue is to miss the true historical significance of this appointment’  Richard Pildes is a professor at the New York University School of Law.  The authority and legitimacy of public institutions takes decades to build up — but can unravel far more quickly. We have been in the midst of a blood feud over the Supreme Court for some years now, which is increasingly likely to cause great damage to an institution the country needs. Like in all blood feuds, each side has its own story of how it all began, which goes back nearly 40 years: You blocked Bork. You denied Garland a hearing. We had to get rid of the filibuster for lower court judges. We had to get rid of it for the Supreme Court. Overwhelmed by the politics of the moment when in power, neither side can stop, making it inevitable that when the worm turns, the other side will up the ante all the more.  To talk about what Amy Coney Barrett would mean for this issue or that issue is to miss the true historical significance of this appointment and what it will mean for the court. If Democrats capture the Senate and White House this fall, the pressures to pack the court will become more formidable than at any time since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s disastrous 1937 attempt (the political backlash against that effort brought about the end of the New Deal). That effort might press to add four new justices, to create a 13-member court with seven Democratic appointees. As soon as the Republicans regain power, they will then take their turn at refashioning the court to serve their aims.  A bespoke court, custom designed and redesigned to serve the interests of the party in power, would lose much of the institutional capital it has built up over two centuries. Perhaps Judge Barrett’s nomination will eventually lead the warring tribes to forge a treaty that reduces the stakes in these appointments (through mechanisms scholars have discussed for years). Or perhaps the stakes in Supreme Court appointments will diminish because one political party gains complete control of government for decades, thus making the court less relevant, as Republicans did after the Civil War and Democrats did during the New Deal. Of course, each side’s firm belief that it is (always) on the cusp of doing that is part of what propels the feud forward.  Barrett deserves a fair hearing — from both sides  Adam J. White is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.  As a judge and a scholar, Amy Coney Barrett has dedicated her career to thoughtful study of interpreting laws and weighing precedents. She would be an ideal Supreme Court justice in any era, but especially in this era, when proper understandings of legal interpretation and stare decisis are of such central importance to the court’s work. There is every reason to expect that Judge Barrett will be an exemplary justice, and the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing should be a good moment to introduce her to the broader American public and to consider the proper role of the court and the rule of law in our constitutional government.'}\n",

The early morning tweet that rocked Washington, and the world: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” This comes after Trump’s top aide, Hope Hicks, started experiencing symptoms and received a positive diagnosis, as Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs first reported Thursday.  Okay, so now what? Well, it certainly seems unlikely that there will be more presidential debates or Trump rallies. The president is now effectively sidelined during the critical final stretch of the campaign. And it seems likely that other high-level White House officials — as well as Biden — will now need to get tested for Covid-19.  ALSO, this is only going to renew a fierce debate on Capitol Hill over testing. Remember, the Capitol still does not have wide-scale testing for people who enter the building, despite pleas from rank-and-file members and even some high-ranking lawmakers such as House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.  A string of lawmakers — who constantly travel back and forth — have already contracted the virus. And not to mention, a number of congressional Republicans have close and pretty regular contact with the president. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin earlier this week to discuss a coronavirus relief deal (Mnuchin tested negative this morning, as well as Vice President Mike Pence).  But Pelosi and McConnell rejected an offer at the beginning of the pandemic to have rapid testing in the Capitol, saying it would be unfair and bad optics since the American people were struggling to get tests at the time.

Learn how Ron and others succeed at McDonald’s.  GROUNDHOG DAY -- Less than 24 hours ago, House Democrats passed their biggest coronavirus relief bill since May. But Congress is no closer to knowing whether any relief money will actually go out the door before Election Day.  Day six of “Will they, won’t they?”... Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Steven Mnuchin say they’ll try at least one more day to clinch a multi-trillion dollar stimulus deal. But both telegraphed Thursday that enormous gaps remained, including state and local government funding, of course, as well as items like the child tax credit. Pelosi herself sounded pessimistic speaking to her members on Thursday, and the White House was accusing Democrats of making “illegal immigration” requests.  Mods in mutiny … Frustration is climbing among endangered members in both parties. Among House Democrats, roughly two dozen frontliners personally texted Pelosi urging her to take a deal with the GOP — many eager for something rather than nothing. And 18 of them actually voted against their party’s partisan bill on the floor Thursday, holding out for a bill that can actually become law and anxious about going home without a deal. “This is just a vote to make people feel good,” said Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa). “I want to help people. That means sitting at the table and getting a damn deal.” The latest from Sarah, your Huddle host and Heather: https://politi.co/3cS14kw  Across the Capitol … some of the GOP’s most vulnerable senators are also starting to get antsy about heading into the election empty-handed. Many Republicans up for reelection say it would be a mistake to adjourn this month without taking any action (though they’re careful not to point any fingers at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell). “There’s no reason we shouldn’t all be here until the election if that’s what it takes to pass a follow up to the CARES Act,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said. More from Burgess and Bres: https://politi.co/3ijP0cR .  PAYBACK’S A MITCH -- The Senate will officially be here next week, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is already teeing up votes on more judges as a kind of a payback for Democrats’ delay tactics in the SCOTUS fight. But even if Republicans can’t get Amy Coney Barrett across the finish line by Nov. 3, McConnell made clear Thursday night that he would move ahead with the vote during the lame-duck — regardless of the less-than-ideal optics. “There are no reduced constitutional prerogatives during either of our tenures,\" McConnell told Fox News.

Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said he was willing but was still upset that the White House reached out the same day RBG was lying in state, per CNN’s Manu Raju.  And the intense public vetting has already begun. NBC News’ Heidi Przybyla reported that Coney Barrett had taken part in a 2006 two-page newspaper ad calling for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, describing the law’s legacy as “barbaric.” And LA Times’ Jennifer Haberkorn revealed that one week before RBG died, Barrett participated in a mock court on the Obamacare case going to the Court next month — in which none of the judges sided with the White House in striking the entire law.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) | Drew Angerer/Getty Images    SCHUMER’S TRICK GETS SIX — A half dozen Senate Republicans, almost all in tight races next month, broke with Trump on Thursday in a symbolic vote about the fate of Obamacare. Just weeks before the election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had forced the health care vote through a rarely used procedural move in protest of the GOP’s quick march to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice, as Alice Miranda Ollstein explains: https://politi.co/33kLcE1 .  Endangered Republicans were split on the vote though. Five were in favor — Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona and Dan Sullivan of Alaska — while the others, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Georgia Sen. David Perdue opposed. (Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who’s not up this year, also voted in favor.)

WHAT RECESSION? — The race to control the White House and Congress in 2020 is shattering records this year, with political spending expected to hit nearly $11 billion, according to a new analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. That’s almost twice the amount spent in 2016. And the battle to control Congress makes up $5.6 billion of that, roughly on par with the 2018 midterm elections. CNN’s Fredreka Schouten explains: https://cnn.it/3jqSQSV .  Just call him CA$H Cunningham ... The Democratic candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) raised an eye-popping $28.3 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced today.  GOP comes to Graham’s rescue ... Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C) is getting a $10 million ad blitz thanks to the Senate GOP leadership PAC. The last-minute cash infusion comes as Graham’s opponent, Jaime Harrison, has defied his own party’s expectations with his massive fundraising haul, largely from small donors. McClatchy DC’s Alex Roarty and Joseph Bustos report: https://bit.ly/3jmYVQs .  ‘Holy crap numbers’... At least seven Democratic candidates exceeded $2 million in the third quarter, with plenty more still to report. Three of those are Democrats hoping to pick up GOP seats — Reps. Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey and Lee Zeldin in New York, and a seat in Colorado where Rep. Scott Tipton was defeated in the primary.

MITCH-IGAN -- Senate Republicans don’t have a ton of opportunities to go on offense this cycle. But they are trying to make a big play in Michigan, where Sen. Gary Peters (D) is up for reelection. A McConnell-aligned super PAC is planning a $9 million ad buy against Peters, per Roll Call. And since the GOP is favored to flip Sen. Doug Jones\\' (D-Ala.) seat, a Republican win in Michigan would make Democrats\\' path to the majority that much more narrow. The deets from Kate Ackley: https://bit.ly/33iSGr2 .

PARTY POOPERS -- Joe Lieberman and his son Matt are doing their darndest to deny their own party a Senate majority, with potentially costly interventions in Maine and Georgia that have Democrats livid. The story from Burgess and James Arkin: “In the wild race for a Georgia Senate seat, Joe’s son Matt Lieberman could play spoiler and allow two Republicans to advance to a runoff. Democrats are calling on Matt to drop out in favor of the party’s preferred candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock, but he is unbowed.  “About 1,000 miles north, Joe Lieberman has endorsed Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) in a race that Democrats likely need to win to seize the majority. Lieberman is even showing up in pro-Collins ads touting the independent bona fides of a Republican that liberals are eager to defeat. Taken together, the events show a political family once at the peak of Democratic politics directly undermining Democrats’ bid to win the Senate and haunting the party nearly eight years after Joe Lieberman left office.” More: https://politi.co/2Sivjb5 .  FREE ADVICE -- House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has a piece of advice for Trump in the next presidential debate: let Joe Biden talk. There’s a feeling in GOP circles that Trump didn’t do himself any favors — in fact, he may have only helped his opponent — by talking over Biden and not even allowing him a chance to slip-up. “Joe Biden usually gets in trouble ... just by talking,” said McCarthy, a top Trump ally. “The more he talks, I think the stronger President Trump’s campaign is.”  But McCarthy’s advice may not even be needed: Even before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump hinted Thursday that he might not participate in the next debate if there’s a rules or format change, as the commission has vowed to do. “Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?” Trump tweeted.  A FIT BY A KING -- Controversial Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) took to the House floor Thursday to re-air his grievances with GOP leadership and the media and defend his infamous interview to the New York Times, in which he questioned how the terms “white nationalist,” “white supremacist,” and “Western civilization” became so offensive.  And yes, that’s the same interview from January 2019 that got King kicked off his committees and contributed to his primary defeat earlier this year. \"They\\'ve got a sanctimonious attitude about what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong,” King said of his own party leaders.  King — whose speech came days after Trump declined to explicitly denounce white supremacy at the first presidential debate — even whipped out charts to try to make his points. Oh, and he also said he’s writing a book, titled “Walking Through the Fire,” that explains it all further, in case you somehow haven’t had enough.

Remember when there was brief panic in Morristown when USPS was spotted removing mailboxes, but it turned out it was to upgrade them?  State Sen. James Beach has proposed a new use for those mailboxes — or at least ones like them.  On Monday, Beach proposed a bill (S2974) that would allow the state or counties to purchase or lease decommissioned mailboxes and use them as ballot drop boxes.  The ballot drop boxes the state purchased for the primary cost more than $5,000 each, so I imagine that could save money. But it would depend on the Postal Service being willing to sell them. And, of course, on security.  If the post office is getting rid of old mailboxes to replace them with more secure “anti-fishing” boxes, can you depend on them for election integrity? I don’t know the answer to this question, because Beach did not return my call and the text of the bill is not yet available to the public.

WHAT TRENTON MADE    PATH TO PROGRESS II: FISCAL BOOGALOO — Committees advance $32.7B budget as Democrats promise to pursue cost-cutting measures, by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: The Senate and Assembly budget committees approved a $32.7 billion nine-month spending plan Tuesday, but not before a lengthy discussion on taxes during which the two Democratic chairs indicated they‘d pursue cost-cutting reforms in the near future. “There is a point in time where we need to stop taxing and to do reforms,” Senate Budget Chair Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) said. “We\\'re at that tipping point.” The budget bill, NJ S2021 (20R) and several accompanying measures were all approved along party lines, although state Sen. Dawn Addiego (D-Burlington), who switched parties from Republican to Democrat in 2019, voted against a proposal to increase the corporate business tax. Democratic lawmakers late Monday introduced a $32.7 billion, nine-month state budget proposal that increases taxes on millionaires from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent and reinstates a 2.5-percent surcharge on corporations that will be phased-out in a few years. It also boosts the state’s surplus to more than $2.5 billion and calls for $4.5 billion in borrowing to help close a revenue shortfall. The spending plan also restores a number of programs Gov. Phil Murphy did not include in the budget he presented to lawmakers.  — Murphy administration agrees to $4.5B in borrowing, by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: Gov. Phil Murphy‘s administration said Tuesday it agrees with state lawmakers that New Jersey should borrow up to $4.5 billion to help plug a revenue hole caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The amount of borrowing lawmakers proposed in their $32.7 billion spending plan is more than the $4 billion Murphy originally sought.  GET YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS OUT BECAUSE IT’S MYSTERY SOLVING TIME — “No one taking responsibility for mandatory minimums amendment,” by NJ Advance Media’s Nikita Biryukov: “No one is taking responsibility for a quietly made amendment adding official misconduct to a list of offenses that will have their mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines excised under a bill working its way through the legislature. The bill, originally penned to remove minimum sentencing guidelines for non-violent property and drug crimes, was quietly amended last month to include official misconduct. State Sen. Sandra Cunningham (D-Jersey City), the bill’s prime Senate sponsor on Tuesday told the New Jersey Globe she did not know who added the provision, and she said she was still undecided on whether or not she would support the quietly added measure.”  MAKING AMENDS — Assembly [amends] bill allowing for early release of prisoners, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: Nearly a month after it stalled, a bill that would allow for the early release many prisoners because of the coronavirus pandemic is expected to be taken up again on Thursday. The Assembly plans to amend the bill, NJ S2519 (20R), to make inmates convicted of murder or aggravated sexual assault ineligible for early release, according to its top sponsor in the lower house. A previous version of the bill, which passed the state Senate in late August but stalled in the lower house, only exempted “repetitive, compulsive” sex offenders. “It is on the board list for the Assembly on Thursday and I am optimistic that there’s sufficient support to pass it, given the fact that we still have the highest prison death rate from Covid-19 in the country,” Assemblymember Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson), the bill’s sponsor, said in a phone interview. “And all of these inmates would have been released within the next 12 months anyway.”  4.1 MASTROS — “NJ contracted $37M for contact tracing. Was there a better way to use taxpayer dollars?” by The Record’s Ashley Balcerzak: “It’s become a dangerous cycle. Public health funding is slashed. An emergency strikes. Governments pour money into the problem and then cut funding once again after the crisis subsides. Local health officials in New Jersey fear that this will happen again. The Garden State agreed to pay close to $37 million in contracts to hire and train contact tracers for six months ... These millions are meant to provide quickly deployed backup to the 99 local and county health departments doing this work since March with limited staff and resources — departments that were forced to pull in volunteers and other public employees to help. But these are still temporary measures to respond to a short-term problem, officials say. It’s unclear what will happen when the contracts end and whether local departments will be given sustained funding to cover the basic infrastructure they require.”  NORTH JERSEY SENIORS STAND ASKED TO STAND ON LINE, WHILE SOUTH JERSEY SENIORS ARE TOLD TO STAND IN LINE — “MVC starts special senior hours but lawmaker says they’ve bungled that, too,” by NJ 101.5’s Dan Alexander: “The Motor Vehicle Commission on Tuesday implemented special hours for senior citizens and people with medical conditions. But one of the lawmakers who sponsored the law making this possible says the MVC is not doing it right … The MVC implemented the new law on Tuesday by allowing the designated customers to take care of transactions related to new and used car purchases at the MVC vehicle centers. The MVC says customers do not need to arrive before 2 p.m. to get a ticket for service. State Sen. Anthony M. Bucco, R-Morris, says the way the MVC is implementing his law will not work. ‘Essentially, what they\\'ve done is now establish another line for those who shouldn\\'t be standing in line, between 2 and 4.’”  RATIOED — Staffing ratio bill amended to save costs for long-term care industry, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: New Jersey lawmakers amended legislation requiring nursing homes and long-term care facilities to keep a minimum number of certified nursing assistants on staff, potentially clearing the way for votes in both houses of the state Legislature later this week. Last week, several Assembly Democrats blanched at language that would have compelled nursing homes to staff one CNA for every six residents during the day shift, noting that provisions for other shifts set a broader parameters for which health workers count against the ratio. Amendments to the bill, NJ S2712 (20R), which cleared both the Assembly Budget Committee and the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, decreases the day shift ratio to one CNA for every eight residents.  DEFENSE: BY ‘TO GO’ HE WAS REFERRING TO THE INDOOR DINING BAN — “In whistleblower lawsuit, fired AC casino exec claims she dealt with misogyny, retaliation,’ by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “A former executive of Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City claims she was fired in retaliation for raising concerns the company filed a falsified document with New Jersey’s gaming division and that the state agency’s director suggested to the company she needed ‘to go,’ according to a whistleblower lawsuit filed Tuesday. Loretta Pickus, the former senior vice president and general counsel at Ocean Casino, also said in her complaint that she was discriminated against because she is a woman.”  COME FOR THE HIGHER TAXES, STAY FOR THE SUPERIOR PIZZA AND INDIAN FOOD — “Some New York lawmakers push to follow New Jersey in raising millionaires’ taxes,” by The Wall Street Journal’s Jimmy Vieklind: “Progressive lawmakers and groups said New Jersey’s agreement to increase taxes on millionaires should be matched in New York, and are pushing the state Legislature here to convene soon to consider a revenue package. A coalition of advocacy group … is planning a Friday protest along Park Avenue to call for taxing the income and wealth of billionaires … The novel coronavirus pandemic prompted a $14.5 billion decline in state revenues, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo has pushed off negotiations on adjusting the state budget in the hope that Congress will appropriate additional aid. The Democratic governor said last week that might mean a delay until after the November election. But some lawmakers say New Jersey’s action undercuts that argument, and they will increase pressure for action. ‘I’ve never been jealous of Jersey before,’ said Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat from Manhattan.”  YAP — \"Pandemic endangers program that provides support for NJ’s most vulnerable kids,\" by WNYC\\'s Matt Katz: \"The coronavirus is decimating government budgets, leaving politicians to snip away part of the safety net intended to catch the most vulnerable—like 12-year-old Jahsaun, identified by the state of New Jersey as at risk of falling into foster care or juvenile detention. Just about every week, Jahsaun hangs out with Sam Barber from Youth Advocate Programs (YAP), a national nonprofit that contracts with the state to pair advocates with 1,500 kids in all 21 counties. Barber’s role is part mentor, part friend, part guy-who-gets-Jahsaun-out-of-the-apartment ... Governor Phil Murphy planned to cut the YAP program by 55 percent due to coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls that is already leading the state to borrow at least $4 billion to balance the budget. On Tuesday, though, officials with the state senate said lawmakers will vote to restore $3 million to the Department of Child and Families, which funds YAP, but it’s still unclear if that will pay for YAP’s $7.8 million line item in its entirety.\"  —“NJ hunters make case for bear hunt on state land as state bear population rises”  —“Seeing tweets on billboards?

When retired police officer and civil rights advocate Richard Rivera sought information about the disciplinary actions through a public records request, police allegedly provided him false information. Rivera was provided a document that stated zero police officers were subject of major discipline in 2015. But that isn’t true, says Rivera’s lawsuit filed on September 11. Police previously released information to a news reporter that stated six police officers were disciplined in 2015 … Public safety director Jerry Speziale declined to comment citing litigation.

Will your vote count?” by The Asbury Park Press’ Erik Larsen and Alex N. Gecan: “The plan, Ocean County Clerk Scott M. Colabella explained during a tour on Sept. 14, was to keep this human assembly line moving 12 hours a day, seven days a week, until the last of some 450,000 ballots are mailed out to the county’s registered voters, a process expected to take weeks. To build some momentum, it was decided to prepare ballots for the county’s smallest municipalities first, giving workers a sense of accomplishment from seeing towns crossed off the to-do list, one by one … Voters in smaller Ocean County towns began receiving their ballots in the mail last week. Officials are urging voters to fill out their ballots and return them as soon as possible to avoid a last-minute crush. Predicting how many will do that is next to impossible. ‘Our greatest fear,’ Kean said, ‘is that we’re going to have 350,000 ballots sent out by mail and 350,000 decide to drop them in the mail on Nov. 1, and we get killed because we get all the ballots at the same time.’”  —Fulop: “Health not headlines: How cities are shifting the immigration narrative”  —“Hunterdon freeholders say JCP&L rate hike should be rejected”      EVERYTHING ELSE    R.I.P. — “\\'It\\'s a difficult week\\': Tyler Clementi\\'s mom shares her journey 10 years after son\\'s death,” by The Record’s Hannan Adely: “Jane Clementi packed the belongings from her home in Ridgewood, where she and her husband had lived for 31 years and raised three boys, into dozens of boxes for her move in February. Into one of those boxes, she placed the writings that her youngest son, Tyler, had scrawled on loose paper and in the back of spiral and marble notebooks … A few weeks ago, she sat down and finally opened the pages. What she read, nearly 10 years after Tyler killed himself so publicly — sparking a national conversation about suicide, mental health and LGBTQ youth — broke her heart all over again: ‘There is nothing in this world that I love or at least nothing I allow myself to love. I just want to go home.

The Brooklyn project, which reached the City Council for a hearing Tuesday, would expand the hub on Sunset Park’s waterfront with retail, offices and more manufacturing, and if you believe the developers, spur the creation of 15,000 new jobs.  On one side is City Council Member Carlos Menchaca, who believes it will drive gentrification in his district and whose opposition would normally be enough to kill the proposal under the Council’s traditions. On the other is a vocal contingent of Council Democrats — Ritchie Torres, Donovan Richards, and Robert Cornegy — who believe a city in an economic crisis cannot afford to lose out on potentially thousands of jobs, and want the body to override Menchaca and allow it to go forward.  In the middle: Bill de Blasio. Amid questions about what his vision for the city’s economic recovery looks like, the mayor has steadfastly declined to take a position. Council members lamented that City Hall has been missing in action, per the Real Deal , and support may hinge on the mayor wading in at the last minute. But on Tuesday, he was sticking to his stance that this isn’t his problem because it’s a private proposal. “The important thing is to let the City Council do its deliberations for now,” he said. Also unclear is the position of Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who finds himself caught between activists on the left and pro-business forces as he mulls whether to go forward with his own run for mayor.  Reps questioned the developers on whether their jobs projections can be believed, considering that the city’s economy has tanked since the estimates were first made. A vote is due by November.

ABOVE THE FOLD: “ROCHESTER POLICE commanders urged city officials to hold off on publicly releasing body camera footage of Daniel Prude’s suffocation death because they feared violent blowback if the video came out during nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd, newly released emails show. Deputy Chief Mark Simmons cited the ‘current climate’ in the city and the nation in a June 4 email advising then-Chief La’ron Singletary to press the city’s lawyers to deny a Prude family lawyer’s public records request for the footage of the March 23 encounter that led to his death. The video, finally made public by Prude’s family on Sept. 4, shows Prude handcuffed and naked with a spit hood over his head as an officer pushes his face against the ground, while another officer presses a knee to his back. The officers held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He was taken off life support a week later. ‘We certainly do not want people to misinterpret the officers’ actions and conflate this incident with any recent killings of unarmed black men by law enforcement nationally,’ Simmons wrote. ‘That would simply be a false narrative, and could create animosity and potentially violent blow back in this community as a result.’ The Western New York city released the emails, police reports and other documents on Monday as Mayor Lovely Warren fired Singletary and suspended Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin and Communications Director Justin Roj without pay for 30 days amid continuing fallout from Prude’s death.

WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “THE ILLNESS was supposed to last for three weeks, doctors told her. But weeks four through six of COVID-19 were the worst for Holly MacDonald. Her low-grade fever morphed into an all-around fatigue. She began having trouble speaking. And when she stood up, her legs and feet turned purple. ‘I’d walk too far and then I’d need to be in bed for three days,’ said MacDonald, who is 29 and lives in Crown Heights. She had to take administrative leave from her job at a nonprofit where she builds social-media campaigns. A month after getting sick in early March, MacDonald was back in the ER, frustrated as she tried to convince her doctors she was mired in her second month of what, she’d been told, was a three-week respiratory virus. She’s still not fully recovered. MacDonald is one of upwards of 70,000 New Yorkers struggling with unexplained long-term symptoms of COVID-19, according to a range of estimates provided by several New York City-area doctors and hospitals contacted by THE CITY.” The City’s Luca Powell  “NEW YORK CITY officials know Covid-19 cases will climb this fall. The question they are watching as the city moves to reopen is, just how much? For months, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has been working with academic groups at Columbia University and New York University. The academic teams have been asked to model case numbers, help predict needed hospital resources and to advise the city on how to open up workplaces, schools, restaurants and more. The disclosure Tuesday of a Covid-19 case at the New York offices of JPMorgan Chase & Co. is likely just the latest example of what will happen as businesses push to get workers back to the office, and people begin going back to school and returning to restaurants and gyms. In interviews, experts from two academic groups working with New York described what’s likely to be a significant increase in cases this fall, but with the opportunity to stop the worst with careful public-health measures like masks and social distancing.” Bloomberg’s Drew Armstrong  THE DE BLASIO ADMINISTRATION shut down in-person learning at a yeshiva in Queens Tuesday morning after at least 13 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed at the school and another six cases are suspected, according to the mayor\\'s office. City Hall officials determined Monday night to suspend in-person learning at Yeshiva Darchei Torah in Far Rockaway. \"Following discussions with senior City Department of Health officials and the yeshiva leadership, we have proposed moving the school to remote learning for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to complete a health investigation and protect students and staff from COVID transmission, given evidence of cases across multiple age levels,\" mayoral spokesman Bill Neidhardt said in an email. POLITICO’s David Giambusso and Amanda Eisenberg  — The yeshiva continued holding in-person classes Tuesday despite the shutdown order.  — A lawsuit by teachers afraid to go back to school amid the Covid-19 pandemic could force the Department of Education to open the floodgates on virus exemptions for teachers just days before the start of classroom learning Monday.  — Another public school has been temporarily closed by the city after two staff members tested positive for Covid-19.  — Teachers at a Manhattan high school, who have worked outside because they say their building is unsafe, were threatened with docked pay if they didn’t return to their classrooms.  — There will be no such thing as snow days in the upcoming school year.  “NEW YORK CITY will restore some trash-collecting services that were cut earlier this summer, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, after complaints about cleanliness and a recent letter from business leaders urging him to improve what they see as deteriorating conditions. The mayor said on Tuesday that he would reallocate some funding to the city’s Department of Sanitation and other agencies to cover the restored services. The cuts to the department were part of a belt-tightening budget and made in response to a financial crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.” Wall Street Journal’s Katie Honan  UNDER CRITICISM from business leaders, Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged private employers Tuesday to begin bringing their workforces back to Manhattan offices. De Blasio said the city is working on a plan to require its own hundreds of thousands of employees to return to work in person, though it will be phased in gradually to make sure the coronavirus stays under control. Under the state’s reopening plan, offices have been allowed to operate at 50 percent of their legal capacity since June. Yet the vast majority of office workers have stayed away: A survey by business groups found that only 8 percent had returned by mid-August, and just over a quarter expected to be back by the beginning of the year. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin      WHAT ALBANY\\'S READING  “THE CUOMO administration is relaxing coronavirus restrictions at nursing homes to allow family members in-person visits with loved ones for the first time since the pandemic hit in March. The announcement Tuesday by state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker comes just three days after relatives of nursing home residents held a rally outside the governor’s Manhattan office protesting the restrictive policy. The new policy will resume limited visitation for facilities that have been without COVID-19 for at least 14 days — half the 28-day rule that has been in effect since early July. Nursing home advocates and family members said the 28-day infection free policy was too restrictive, with only a small percentage of the 613 nursing homes meeting the criteria to allow visitors. But Zucker said the updated guidance will allow visitation in approximately 500 of the state’s 613 nursing homes.” New York Post’s Carl Campanile and Bernadette Hogan  “HUNDREDS of thousands of New York motorists have put off their vehicle inspection during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving auto shops bracing for an onslaught of customers whenever Gov. Andrew Cuomo decides to restore the annual requirement. As of Sept. 4, New York auto shops had performed 739,000 fewer inspections since March compared to the average over the same period the prior five years, a decrease of about 11%, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles.” USA Today Network’s Jon Campbell  “A WEEK after health officials warned Labor Day weekend could bring a possible uptick in COVID-19 cases, that holiday doesn\\'t appear to have contributed to a surge in New York — but out-of-state travel is still considered one of the core threats to the state\\'s low infection rate.  Puerto Rico was added back to the tri-state quarantine list Tuesday, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced, while six states — California, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio — were removed, bringing the number of restricted U.S. areas to 30.

So far, Governor Andrew Cuomo has been relying on temporary measures to keep the state afloat, but fiscal experts say it’s time to make some hard decisions. E.J. McMahon, with the conservative leaning fiscal watchdog group, the Empire Center, and Ron Deutsch, with the liberal leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, do agree on some things. One- that the amount of the state deficit is huge, Cuomo’s budget office estimates it has grown to $14.5 billion dollars. And two, that it’s time to be worried. ‘I think alarm bells should be going off all over the place right now,’ Deutsch said.” New York State Public Radio’s Karen DeWitt  — \"Despite a fiscal crisis that led Governor Cuomo to withhold aid payments for school districts and local governments, the Cuomo administration since spring has approved more than $46 million in new pork-barrel capital grants.”  “OFFICIALS at the state Department of Labor on Monday terminated a fugitive with a lengthy criminal history, including arrests for identification theft, who had been among hundreds of clerks hired since March to help process unemployment claims…His termination, which was confirmed by sources in the department, came a day after the Times Union published a story revealing his criminal history and that highlighted what employees in the department characterized as a loosening of the verification process to approve more than 3 million unemployment claims since the coronavirus pandemic struck New York earlier this year.” Times Union’s Brendan J. Lyons  GOV. Andrew Cuomo is blaming politicians beholden to utility interests for limiting penalties those companies can face when the lights go out. “These utility companies, I believe, would rather pay these penalties for slow response than invest the money they need to actually prevent it from happening,” Cuomo said Tuesday during a radio appearance with Long Island’s Jay Oliver. “There’s a state law that says the state is limited as to how much they can penalize a utility company after a storm or anything like that ... This is a utility protection program.” ... Senate Democrats, who won a majority for the first time in decades in 2018, took issue with Cuomo’s comments. “We agree with the governor that the previous Republican Senate majority was on the side of utility companies and not the public,” said Mike Murphy, spokesperson for the Senate Democrats. “We look forward to changing that.\" POLITICO’s Marie J.

One former HHS official told POLITICO that Caputo, a former Trump campaign official, has long complained of the stress caused by having been mentioned in the special counsel\\'s investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election. During the meeting with his staff on Tuesday, Caputo made allusions to the fact that HHS had functioned for a long time in the past without a permanent top communications official, said one HHS official.

The former counsel to the mayor becomes the latest candidate to formally enter the 2021 race. At a launch event in Brooklyn on Thursday, she went straight at what could be one of her biggest liabilities among progressive voters — her association with the incumbent.  “When I am mayor you will never have to wonder who is in charge,” said Wiley, who until recently was a legal analyst for MSNBC and would be New York’s first female mayor. “You will never have to question whether ... the mayor even wants the job,” she said, a day after de Blasio cracked that no one should covet his gig these days. And she took a direct shot at de Blasio’s failed run for president: “You will never have to wonder whether I’m in Iowa.”  Wiley, who chaired the city’s police watchdog panel, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, also split with de Blasio on the firing of NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who the department took five years to terminate for the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. And she said she disapproved of the mayor’s use of a state statute to keep police disciplinary records secret, before it was repealed this summer. But asked how she had used her own City Hall perch to fight those battles, she cited legal confidentiality and declined to say.  Out of the gate, Wiley picked up the support of state Sen. Mike Giannaris, City Council Members Steve Levin and Helen Rosenthal, and Assemblymember Michael Blake. She joins City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who formally launched his campaign last month, while another prominent contender, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, recently chose to bow out .

WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “A GROUP OF Jewish organizations and the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn are separately suing Governor Andrew Cuomo to stop the state from enforcing attendance limits on house of worship in parts of New York that have been designated for new restrictions due to rising coronavirus cases. The lawsuits mark an expected and ongoing legal battle spearheaded by religious groups who have decried the governor\\'s limits on religious services amid the pandemic. On Tuesday, Cuomo called for zoned shutdowns in four virus hotspot regions, including portions of South Brooklyn and Queens, and two suburban communities in Rockland and Orange counties that are home to significant numbers of Orthodox residents. In ‘red zones,’ areas with the highest test positivity, no more than 10 people will be allowed to attend houses of worship. The complaint by Jewish groups and individuals, which was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, described the state\\'s rules as ‘onerous and discriminatory’ and a violation of the First Amendment.” Gothamist’s Elizabeth Kim  “HAROLD ‘HESCHY’ TISCHLER strolled onto 13th Avenue in Borough Park at 9 p.m. Wednesday night, bare-faced and hoarse from days of screaming, and into the arms of an adoring crowd. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators chanted his name, waving Trump and Thin Blue Lines flags as they jockeyed for a chance to meet the brash right-wing radio host leading the campaign to stop the new COVID-19 lockdown measures. ‘We are at war!’ Tischler shouted to the crowd of protesters. ‘You are my soldiers!’ An hour later, Tischler directed an angry mob of young Hasidic men as they surrounded and attacked Jacob Kornbluh, a veteran reporter with Jewish Insider …  “It was the second straight night of rage and violence in Borough Park overseen by Tischler , a heavyset local agitator who spent a year in prison for immigration fraud. During his demonstration on Tuesday, protesters beat up the brother of a well-known Hasidic whistleblower, swarmed a photojournalist documenting the scene, and set fire to surgical masks in the street. There were no arrests or summonses during either night of unrest, according to an NYPD spokesperson. The chaotic street scene marked the latest escalation in the fight over Governor Andrew Cuomo’s new coronavirus restrictions, which will shut down schools and non-essential businesses in Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods with spiking COVID rates beginning on Thursday. Local Hasidic lawmakers who represent the area have come out against the rules, accusing the governor of singling out Jewish people... But Tischler has gone a step further, vowing to stop the restrictions by force, while peddling conspiracy theories that Democratic officials are deliberately misleading the public about the virus for political reasons.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz  — De Blasio and Cuomo both criticized the NYPD’s approach after no arrests were made during the first two nights of protests, where multiple people were assaulted.  “AL, AN FDNY EMT who makes ambulance runs all over southwest Brooklyn, has seen a change as of late. While responding to 911 medical calls from Bensonhurst to Borough Park in the months past the pandemic’s peak, he’d field a cardiac arrest case about once every other week, he estimates. But in the last two weeks, he’s logged nearly 10. His wife, an EMT in Brownsville and Crown Heights, responded to four cardiac arrest calls in one day recently, he said. For them, the runs stir memories of near-constant cardiac arrest calls in the spring for COVID-19 patients whose hearts couldn’t get enough oxygen. ‘I’m hoping and praying that it doesn’t get to where it was in March and in April,’ said Al, who requested that his last name not be used because he is not authorized to speak to the press. ‘I don’t foresee that happening again to that level, but I do see there being an increase.’ Citywide, ambulance calls in New York are down from the height of the COVID-19 crisis, even dipping slightly below pre-pandemic levels, officials said. But in and around the city’s coronavirus hot zones in Brooklyn and Queens, emergency workers are spotting a difference lately — and New Yorkers there say they are hearing it, too, in the drone of sirens.” The City’s Rachel Holliday Smith  “A BAND OF downtown Manhattan residents are raising nearly $1 million to fight Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to relocate homeless residents from an Upper West Side emergency hotel shelter to a permanent facility in their neighborhood, The Post has learned. The newly formed non-profit group, Downtown New Yorkers Inc., has hired the high-profile international law firm Cozen O’Connor in preparation of filing an emergency injunction against the city to block the move. ‘I think we have a really great strategy if we need it,’ the group’s co-founder, Chris Brown, told The Post Thursday.” New York Post’s Julia Marsh and Natalie Musumeci  “WHEN NEW YORK recently said that restaurants could offer outdoor dining year-round, it was a decision these establishments quickly lauded. But for Roni Mazumdar, who owns Indian restaurants in the city, the news was a harsh reminder that the playing field isn’t the same for every dining spot. Mr. Mazumdar is limited by the fact that he can’t set up an outdoor platform in front of two of his places. At Rahi, located in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighborhood, a fire hydrant stands in his way. And at Adda Indian Canteen in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, a bus stop blocks the area. Mr. Mazumdar isn’t alone in facing such problems. Many of the city’s restaurants have been able to offer outdoor service without complications, and plan to keep doing so even as the weather turns chilly. But others are challenged by the city’s rules that govern the pandemic-era outdoor dining program, known as Open Restaurants, that has now been made permanent year-round.” Wall Street Journal’s Charles Passey  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Eight of the nine candidates for Manhattan District Attorney signed a joint letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo urging him to use his clemency powers to release older people from New York prisons. The plea was organized by the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club, which hosted the first candidate forum in the crowded DA race and asked the contenders to pledge their support for the issue. “We urge you to exercise your executive clemency powers to free all elder prisoners, including those convicted of more serious crimes, unless there is an overwhelming and individualized reason to keep them incarcerated,” write the candidates — Tahanie Aboushi, Alvin Bragg, Diana Florence, Lucy Lang, Janos Marton, Eliza Orlins, Daniel Quart, Tali Farhadian Weinstein — arguing that older people are unlikely to commit new crimes and are at higher risk from coronavirus. One candidate, Liz Crotty, declined to sign.

By Thursday morning, David announced he tested positive for the virus and was discharged after spending the night at Auburn Community Hospital, where he received a test after the Syracuse event.” USA Today Network’s Anthony Borrelli, Jon Campbell and Georgie Silvarole  — “Albany County saw a worrying increase in the number of positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reported overnight. County Executive Dan McCoy said Thursday there were 20 new cases and three more patients were hospitalized. That brings the county’s hospitalizations to seven, including two people in intensive care. McCoy said he was concerned about the sharp rise in cases over the last week. ‘We don’t need to sound the alarms yet, but we need to take this moment as a warning sign and look at our own data in Albany County: Nearly 150 new positive cases in just one week, the number of residents in the hospital more than doubled over three days and the number of patients in the ICU is ticking up,’ he said.” Times Union Staff  — “Thirteen Erie County residents have died of Covid-19 over the past eight days, marking the highest death total over such a short period of time since mid-July. Six died in hospitals at a time when overall county hospitalizations and patients in intensive care have recently seen a slight, but generally sustained, elevation of numbers. According to state data, Western New York\\'s counties of Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany had 56 patients hospitalized due to the coronavirus on Wednesday.” Buffalo News’ Keith McShea and Sandra Tan  “BRAD HOYLMAN, a 54-year-old Pfizer-trial participant, has dealt with intense vaccine skepticism . A state senator from New York, Mr. Hoylman sponsored legislation that removed a religious exemption for vaccinating schoolchildren, following New York’s 2019 measles outbreak. Vaccine opponents had hounded his staff and his family before Covid, and when he posted photos of himself receiving Covid vaccine shots in August, the internet trolls were waiting. ‘May your family suffer for eternity,’ tweeted one person over a manipulated photo of Mr. Hoylman with a knife held to his neck. Covid vaccine trials are standard, double-blind studies. For most trials, half of participants receive the vaccine candidate and the rest get a placebo.

Rivals including Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal have also cut jobs in recent months as the film and TV business struggles.”  MAKING MOVES — Rosemonde Pierre-Louis has joined the executive board of the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting NYC, replacing Maya Wiley, who stepped down in advance of launching her campaign for mayor.

REAL ESTATE  “THOUGH many developers and investors have recently been outspoken in calling for offices to reopen and workers to return to their pre-Covid routines, most trade organizations have come out in support of Cuomo’s restrictions, chief among them the Real Estate Board of New York. His orders range from limiting services to a broader lockdown, which shuts down non-essential businesses, schools and outdoor dining, and reduces the number of people allowed in places of worship to a maximum of 10. New York real estate leaders have largely agreed with the governor’s argument that economic recovery hinges not just on reopening, but controlling the spread of the coronavirus.” The Real Deal’s Erin Hudson and Sasha Jones  “THE LATEST report on apartment rents in New York appears to paint the same picture drawn since the pandemic first shook confidence in the city: Vacancies are soaring, especially in Manhattan, and rents are falling — both an apparent consequence of people fleeing. But other numbers — including an uptick in Manhattan lease signings to near pre-pandemic levels even as more apartments go on the market — suggest the flight from the city could be ebbing . That jibes with what Dan Menchini, owner of U Santini Inc. movers in Brooklyn, has seen in recent weeks. ‘The exodus has slowed down a lot,’ he said Thursday. ‘We’re back to moving people within the city and when people need to relocate because they are doing construction work on their homes.’” The City’s Greg David  Follow us on Twitter Erin Durkin @erinmdurkin    Anna Gronewold @annagronewold'}\n",

Some new trouble spots: The city is seeing upticks in Covid-19 cases in half a dozen neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.  In Midwood, Flatbush, Borough Park and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and Far Rockaway and Kew Gardens in Queens, officials have recorded an increased number of new cases and are warning about illicit large indoor gatherings that may fuel the spread.  “We’re now seeing signals that Covid is spreading in some neighborhoods faster and wider than the rest of the city,” said Health Commissioner Dave Chokski, who outlined plans to target the affected areas with testing, mask and hand sanitizer distribution, and robo-calls and sound trucks urging adherence to social distancing rules.  That’s part of a hyper-local approach intended to stop isolated spikes from becoming bigger ones, and it managed to bring numbers back down after a recent uptick in Sunset Park. But the latest problems are more widespread. The spikes in southern Brooklyn have risen to the level of an official coronavirus cluster, dubbed the Ocean Parkway Cluster, the Health Department said Tuesday evening. New cases there have tripled since the beginning of August, and have also tripled in Far Rockaway and Williamsburg, while they’ve doubled in Kew Gardens. Collectively, the neighborhoods make up 20 percent of all cases citywide. Without action, officials say the increases could spread to other areas.  Citywide, the infection rate remains just over 1 percent. The reopening of most city schools and indoor dining next week will add more risk factors to the mix.”When these second waves occur, they always start as small problems that expanded to big ones,” said Jay Varma, public health adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio. “So our aggressive approaches are absolutely critical to prevent that from happening.”  IT’S WEDNESDAY.

WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “A DAUNTING HURDLE still remains before New York City schools reopen. After a summer of last-minute scrambles to ready city schools for in-person learning, what could be the toughest challenge yet is the recruitment, hiring and training of thousands of new teachers in just over a week. Between 6,000 and 7,000 extra teachers will have to be in place when middle and high schools open Oct. 1 to staff a dizzying array of remote and in-person courses, United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew told the Daily News. ‘It’s gonna go right down to the wire. It’s not going to be easy,’ he said. City officials, who pushed back the start of in-person school last week to address the staffing crisis, have already committed to 4,500 new staff for elementary schools\\' reopening Sept. 29, and acknowledged they’ll need even more for middle and high schools. They haven’t shared what that number is.” New York Daily News’ Michael Elsen-Rooney  — Online classes may be as large as 68 students.  — Some students still lack the iPads or laptops they need for online learning.  — The Education Department\\'s deputy chancellor of school planning and design plans to take a leave of absence to work on Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.  — De Blasio sparked confusion by claiming that students will not have to take online classes while they’re physically in school, even though several schools have already announced plans to do so.  BROOKLYN’S MUNICIPAL building will be renamed after late Supreme Court justice and borough native Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday. “It’s personal for all of us as New Yorkers. It’s personal for so many people who are inspired by her as a guiding light and an example,” de Blasio said at a press briefing. “We want to make sure we honor her in every conceivable way, and especially in the borough that she came from.” Ginsburg, who died on Friday at the age of 87, grew up in Midwood and attended James Madison High School. The nearly century-old Municipal Building on Joralemon Street in downtown Brooklyn will now bear her name. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin  “THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL is considering several bills that would aid restaurants as they try to recover from the economic hit brought on by the new coronavirus pandemic, including one that would make sidewalk and curbside street dining permanent. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in July that the Open Restaurants program, a key feature of the city’s effort to support restaurants financially during the pandemic, would be extended until Oct. 31. The program allows restaurants and bars to expand outdoor seating in sidewalks, city streets and parking lots to increase revenue while maintaining social-distancing guidelines intended to curb the spread of the virus. As part of the legislation introduced by City Councilman Antonio Reynoso, restaurants and bars would also be allowed to use propane heaters, which are currently banned in New York City. The Department of Transportation would also be required to set up an online application process that can be used by restaurateurs to certify their establishments for outdoor dining, according to the bill.” Wall Street Journal’s Emma Tucker  — De Blasio says he’ll make a decision “very soon” on extending outdoor dining past Oct. 31.  “NEW YORK CITY’S Civilian Complaint Review Board closed 804 fewer cases in the fiscal year ending June 30 compared to 2019, as average investigation times increased for the fifth consecutive year, according to the latest Mayor’s Management Report. It now takes CCRB investigators nearly 11 months to complete an investigation that results in a substantiated complaint, compared to about nine months in fiscal year 2019 and less than six months in 2016, the report shows. The increase occurred even as the agency received 639 fewer complaints … CCRB officials blamed the latest delays on the impact of COVID-19, uncooperative cops and a police department that has stymied their ability to view body camera footage as part of misconduct investigations.” Queens Eagle’s David Brand and Rachel Vick      WHAT ALBANY\\'S READING  “AS COVID-19 ravaged New York nursing homes, 62 of the facilities were cited for violations of infection-control standards, which are crucial to stopping the spread of viruses and other deadly diseases, federal and state data showed. A USA TODAY Network New York review found the most serious violations revealed how poorly trained workers mishandled COVID-19 contaminated food trays, linens, gowns and mop buckets, potentially spreading the respiratory disease among countless frail and elderly residents. Many nursing homes also failed to isolate infected residents, including cases of healthy residents left to live with roommates who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One facility was cited for potentially exposing 89 residents to COVID-19 due to the violations. And amid widespread personal protective equipment shortages, one nursing home was cited for keeping its stockpile locked up improperly, endangering workers who complained they lacked masks, gloves and gowns, according to federal and state records reviewed by USA TODAY Network New York.” USA Today Network’s David Robinson  “A WEALTHY cosmetics heir and longtime fixture in New York State fundraising politics is donating mightily to a Super PAC that has targeted a half-dozen state Senate Democrats for defeat.

Organizers of Safe Together New York say their goal is to simply highlight to voters that Democrats have been in charge of the Legislature and responsible for changes in criminal justice laws, such as relaxing bail requirements in many criminal cases, that have contributed to spikes in crime rates...  \"The group’s calculus does not appear to be the return of Republicans to power in the state Senate, which would be a steep climb anyway in blue state New York in a presidential election year. Rather, Democrats believe the group is trying to prevent them from attaining super majority status in the 63-member chamber, which would have Senate Democrats joining Assembly Democrats in a potentially potent alliance during state budget talks or in the crucial post-Census process in 2022, in which lawmakers will re-draw their own district lines as well as the districts for all New York members of the U.S. Congress.” Buffalo News’ Tom Precious  “HIS DEATH has roiled Rochester: The city’s mayor, Lovely Warren, has since fired the chief of police and suspended the seven officers involved in the encounter; the state attorney general’s office has opened its own investigation and a grand jury will now examine the case.

The money will go to fund a program organized by the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition to pay the fines, fees and restitution costs for former prisoners who are already registered to vote in Florida but barred by law from participating in the election because of those outstanding debts. Bloomberg, who has committed at least $100 million to electing Biden in the state, raised the money from individuals and foundations over the past week, his advisers said. He saw the donations as a more cost-effective way of adding votes to the Democratic column than investing money to persuade voters who already have the right to vote, a Bloomberg memo said.” Washington Post’s Michael Scherer  “A FEDERAL JUDGE in Manhattan granted a request for relief on Monday from 16 named plaintiffs, including candidates and voters, to ensure that the United States Postal Service delivers absentee ballots on time across the country, and to United States citizens abroad, calling the right to vote “too vital a value in our democracy to be left in a state of suspense in the minds of voters weeks before a presidential election.” Citing the expected surge in absentee ballot use due to the risk posed by the ongoing global pandemic, Victor Marrero, a judge in the Southern District of New York, said the plaintiffs successfully argued that new policy changes implemented by President Donald Trump and his handpicked Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, were causing service delivery delays that would interfere with the delivery of election mail. The policy changes, part of DeJoy’s “transformative initiative,” include reduction of overtime pay, elimination of mail sorting machines, and directing mail trucks to leave as scheduled even if that meant leaving mail behind for delivery another day.” WNYC’s Brigid Bergin  TRUMP\\'S NEW YORK  “PRESIDENT TRUMP’s politicized campaign to label New York City an ‘anarchist jurisdiction’ broadened on Tuesday, with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency threatening to move its regional headquarters out of Lower Manhattan.

Elizabeth Warren is headed to New Hampshire this weekend to campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Warren will also make a stop in Maine, according to the Biden campaign.  The former presidential candidate is among a host of Bay State Democrats stumping for the former vice president, often virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has appeared at several Biden events as a surrogate, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley hosted a virtual phone bank. Rep. Lori Trahan attended a \"Portuguese Americans for Biden-Harris\" launch event last weekend.  Warren\\'s trip over the border on Saturday comes as a new poll shows Biden with a double-digit lead in the Granite State. Likely New Hampshire voters say they prefer Biden by a 12-point margin, 53% to 41%, according to a St. Anselm College/New Hampshire Institute of Politics poll released on Thursday . The poll was conducted Oct. 1 to Oct. 4 and has a 2.9% margin of error.  That\\'s a significant slip for Trump, who came close to winning New Hampshire in 2016. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire with the smallest margin of any state in the country, prompting Trump to make unfounded claims that voter fraud caused his loss there. And it\\'s also a turnaround for Biden in some ways — he came in fifth in the New Hampshire primary and left the state before the votes were tallied.  New Hampshire is a small prize — the state only has four electoral votes, compared to Florida\\'s 29 votes or Pennsylvania\\'s 20 votes. But the Trump campaign has put resources there over the last several months. Trump held a rally in Londonderry at the end of August; Vice President Mike Pence and the president\\'s sons have made visits to the state. Bay State Trump supporters have also visited the state to express their support. A caravan of Massachusetts Republicans calling themselves the \"Trump Train\" drove from Plymouth to Londonderry last week.

But that's not an easy lift in lower-income districts that lack funding and resources.  The constant stream of disasters and debacles over the past two years has rattled even the most senior lawmakers, putting everyone on edge about what terrible catastrophe could possibly happen next.  “It’s probably the most tumultuous, challenging atmosphere I’ve ever seen up here. And not just for us — this represents what’s going on in the nation. Unusual. Unprecedented,” said veteran Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who was first elected to Congress in 1978. “But when a plague comes, it compounds all the other problems.”  As it sputters from crisis to crisis, Congress — already the most detested branch of government — has somehow discovered more ways to disappoint the American public. Both sides agree on just one thing: The partisan politics are outright toxic, and getting worse with each earth-shattering development.  “The hits just keep coming,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who said trying to follow the frenetic news cycles has been like “drinking out of a water hose.”  “Just when you think you have it figured out, something happens,” added Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who served in the House for several terms before assuming his current Senate seat in January 2019.  Even veteran lawmakers say the period feels unprecedented, comparing the political upheaval to the Civil Rights era of the late 1960s or World War II, or in more recent times, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  But now, Republicans and Democrats are wrestling with the overlapping crises of the economy, social justice, public health and discord of the Trump era, generally.  Lawmakers have achieved some success, such as a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that delivered badly needed aid to the most desperate Americans in the early stages of the pandemic. And House Democrats have passed much of their own ambitious agenda, from police reform to protecting Dreamers to infrastructure, only to see it ignored by the GOP-controlled Senate.  Things have gotten so bad, though, that the House and Senate couldn’t renew a law designed to help the victims of violent crimes, let alone another badly needed coronavirus aid bill. The Senate has been unable to pass anti-lynching legislation. And this week, the Senate couldn't even agree on a nonbinding resolution honoring Ginsburg amid a heated dispute over filling the Supreme Court vacancy in an election year.  Lawmakers on the left and the right are now casually discussing extreme tactics that could inflict permanent damage on the institution. Democrats are considering blowing up the filibuster and packing the Supreme Court isn’t off the table if Republicans do, indeed, confirm a high court pick with just days to go before the election.\"}\n",

Francis had started writing the encyclical, the third of his pontificate, before the coronavirus struck and upended everything from the global economy to everyday life. He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus.  “Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,” Francis wrote. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”  He cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the virus as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.  “The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,” he wrote. “It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at ‘promoting an economy that favours productive diversity and business creativity’ and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.”  He denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a “culture of encounter” that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.  As an outgrowth of that, Francis repeated his criticism of the “perverse” global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few. Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the “social purpose” and common good that must come from sharing the Earth’s resources.  Francis once again rejected “trickle-down” economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn’t achieve what it claims.  “Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of ‘spillover’ or ‘trickle’ — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,” he wrote. “There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged ‘spillover’ does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.”  Much of the new encyclical repeats Francis’ well-known preaching about the need to welcome and value migrants and his rejection of the nationalistic, isolationist policies of many of today’s political leaders.  He dedicated an entire chapter to the parable of the Good Samaritan, saying its lesson of charity, kindness and looking out for strangers was “the basic decision we need to make in order to rebuild our wounded world.”  '}\n",

Governors walk a narrow tightrope in a big tent  In liberal California, Democrats are the only game in town. They control every statewide office and wield Republican-proof supermajorities in the Legislature — and that adds up to big ambitions for progressive Democrats and their allies in organized labor.  Despite the national caricature of Newsom as a starry-eyed San Francisco liberal, in California he’s always been seen as more of a business-friendly centrist. He also has deep ties to a technology industry that has increasingly clashed with unions. That means Newsom is constantly trying to balance those constituencies as he faces decisions that will inevitably frustrate someone.  \"I think it’s fair to say that organized labor has done a very good job of becoming influential in California and that business has done a good job of becoming un-influential over time and you have to appreciate the position the governor is in,\" said Jim Wunderman, CEO of a business coalition called the Bay Area Council. “This is a really important point we’re at now because the business position is not good,\" he added.  The shifting fortunes of Big Tech offer a prime example. Gig economy firms like Uber and Doordash are under intense pressure from organized labor, which championed a law that could upend their business models by forcing them to treat drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. Newsom has consistently advocated for a deal that could placate both sides by bridging the contractor-employee dichotomy, and he has stayed neutral on a tech-funded ballot initiative to get out from under the sweeping labor law.  A pandemic-induced recession has intensified those tensions. Democratic mayors, unions and liberal activists have pushed Newsom to raise taxes; business groups have warned that could derail a stuttering economy recovery. Newsom charted a middle course last week when he backed a labor-backed initiative to raise commercial property taxes, but Newsom also flatly rejected a union campaign to raise taxes on the most affluent Californians.  “There’s this tremendous chasm and there’s really no way to fit in between it without falling into it,” Wunderman said. “The tech industry has the benefit of knowing him and he understand the future is going to be different,” but “at the same time I do think he has a very focused concern on the plight of people and wants to be the governor who ensure the little guy isn’t getting screwed over.”  Carla Marinucci and Victoria Colliver contributed to this report.'}\n",

We know that much. But there are lots of unknowns about his condition, and his medical team isn't filling in the gaps.  “Contact tracing President Trump in Minnesota: Who hung out with him for how long?” blared a headline in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. The Duluth News Tribune’s above-the-fold front page read simply, “[Rep. Pete] Stauber traveled with Trump.” No further context was necessary.  Photographs of the Duluth rally appeared on social media with red circles drawn around people standing closest to the lectern — and to Trump. Stauber and two other Republican congressmen who traveled with Trump on Air Force One were pilloried for returning to the state on a Delta Airlines flight on Friday night — apparently flouting airline rules.  The House members’ “stupidity and disregard for the well-being of their fellow passengers is staggering,” Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said in a prepared statement.  Gary Anderson, the Democratic president of the Duluth City Council, said Sunday that Trump “took risks with the health of our community, clearly, and I think that’s how our community is worse off in the most direct way.”  Minnesota, a state Trump lost by fewer than 45,000 votes four years ago, wasn’t supposed to end like this for Trump. It was supposed to be where he stunned all the naysayers this year. Appearing at a rally in Duluth in 2018 to campaign for Stauber, Trump pinched his thumb and forefinger together and told the crowd he’d come “this close” to winning the state, something no Republican has done since Richard Nixon in 1972. One more visit, “one more speech,” he said, and he would have. In 2020, Trump said, “It’s going to be really easy I think.”  Duluth is critical to Trump’s ambitions. Though the city itself is a progressive enclave on the tip of Lake Superior, its media market gives Trump a port of entry to the state’s more conservative Iron Range, a blue-collar mining region that, while ancestrally Democratic, has been trending Republican in recent years.  Trump carried the congressional district surrounding Duluth by 15 percentage points in 2016, and he will need to juice turnout there this year to compensate for losses in the Democratic-heavy Twin Cities and their suburbs. In a year marked by little campaign travel, Trump has lavished attention on Northern Minnesota, dispatching family members to Duluth and appearing himself in Bemidji, Minn., in mid-September. Several mayors from the area publicly endorsed him.  One them, Larry Cuffe Jr., a former Democrat and the mayor of small town Virginia, recalled Sunday that Trump’s campaign provided hand sanitizer and distributed masks at the rally in Duluth last week. Cuffe and the people he was with were all wearing masks, he said, and he wasn’t worried about contracting the virus there.  What’s more, Trump looked good to him. Trump’s speech, Cuffe said, “was even more poignant and more to the point” than he had seen at previous events.\"}\n",

Last year, Trump called for Omar and some of her progressive peers in Congress to “go back” to “the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.” Trump supporters also chanted “send her back” during a rally last year, a line that has become common among his base.  During a rally last week, Trump called Omar an “extremist” and said Democrats wanted to allow into the country Somali and Yemeni refugees who he said were coming from “Jihadist regions.” He also bragged about deporting Somali nationals during that rally, calling them “hardened criminals” who are “back in their country where they can do all the complaining they want.” He held the rally in Minnesota, the state with one of the largest ethnic Somali communities in the country.

But Democrats ultimately bailed on the initiative the night before it was supposed to be announced, McCarthy said.  President Donald Trump and the GOP — who have made cracking down on China a central campaign theme — have tried to paint Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as soft on China. Democrats, of course, reject the charges and point out that Trump initially touted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s response to the coronavirus.  The GOP's report lays out 83 key findings and makes 430 policy recommendations, two-thirds of which are bipartisan, according to McCarthy. Since its inception, the task force has met with 125 people, including policy experts, business leaders, lawmakers, and current and former administration officials.  “It is not only the most thorough report on China in the history of the House, it’s bold, achievable, and bipartisan,” McCarthy told reporters. “It doesn’t just lay out the challenges, it lays out the solutions.”  The blueprint calls for securing medical and national security supply chains, striking a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan and limiting the Thrift Savings Plan from investing in certain Chinese companies. The report also calls for evaluating whether the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes against humanity in Xinjiang amount to genocide and providing a safe harbor for Hong Kong refugees.  During a news conference, task force members highlighted the stack of recommendations that already have strong bipartisan support and expressed hope that many of them could actually become law.  “I don’t know of another issue in American politics that united me and Chuck Schumer as closely as countering the Chinese Communist Party,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.).  McCarthy, when pressed on whether he thought Biden would be willing to implement these recommendations if he wins the White House, said he was concerned that the former vice president wouldn’t be as tough as the Trump administration in standing up to China.  “I would hope Joe Biden would read this report,” McCarthy said. “But that would be a real concern to me of why switching administrations would be wrong.”  McCarthy has also highlighted the China Task Force recommendations in his election-year agenda that was released earlier this month, signaling it would be a top priority for the GOP if they win back the House.\"}\n",

Thirty percent of the people in the suburbs are minorities. And so we’re ruining this American dream for everybody,” Trump said.  \"They zone you out, they build low-income housing next to your house,\" Trump continued. \"And then I hear I\\'m not doing well in the suburbs. I\\'m not doing well in the suburbs — are you people crazy?\"  One charitable interpretation of his comments is that minorities and low-income people are themselves negatively affected by policies the president opposes. But in his boasts of saving suburbia, Trump seemed to insinuate that minorities and low-income people are overrunning the suburbs and displacing the white voters the president consistently tries to appeal to. Trump repeatedly uses vague language when talking about the suburbs that allows audiences to apply their own interpretations.  During the debate on Wednesday, the president also decried racial sensitivity training in government agencies, declaring, “I ended it because it\\'s racist.” He vilified the training, which is designed to make workplaces more equitable and tolerant environments, as a program that was “teaching people to hate our country.”  When repeatedly asked by reporters Wednesday outside the White House whether he would denounce white supremacists, Trump backtracked, saying he\\'s \"always denounced any form, any form, any form of any of that.\" On Thursday, in an interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said, \"I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys.\" But by then, hate groups like the Proud Boys had already received the message: Minutes after the debate, the Proud Boys crafted a logo with Trump\\'s \"stand by\" phrase.  The president’s remarks are part of a campaign strategy centered on white grievance politics that Republicans have employed since the 1960s. But Trump is using a megaphone.  It was a strategy that proved successful in 2016. But, in 2020, Trump’s appeals to white voters are yielding diminishing returns.  The playbook: Republicans have won a majority of the white vote since the 1960s. And white voters carried Trump to victory in 2016 with white women and non-college educated whites pushing him over the top. His comments Wednesday, which promoted housing segregation, represent one of several heavy-handed appeals his campaign has made to these groups in the hopes of saving his reelection bid.  To win, Trump needs to pull back white women, who started to move away from Republicans in 2018 — and Tuesday’s debate didn’t help him in that area, as a number of Republican commentators acknowledged.  “The women voters who are the target audience for last night and the undecided voters — a lot of them are tired with the tone and tenor of this administration and this president,” Alice Stewart, a Republican commentator told CNN.  But Trump continued the white grievance playbook on Wednesday. As part of his false claim that Biden wants to “inundate [Minnesota] with a historic flood of refugees,” the president attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is an American citizen, for her Somali roots. He also falsely accused her of illegal ballot harvesting. The practice is legal in some states, including Minnesota, and allows a third party to collect and deliver ballots.  “What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports about how corrupt and crooked she is,” Trump said to chants of “lock her up!” during the rally. “Then she tells us how to run our country — can you believe it?”  Weekly Score Your guide to the year-round campaign cycle.

The math: While Trump aims to coalesce the groups that underpinned his 2016 base, Biden is closing in on them. The RealClearPolitics national polling average shows the former vice president ahead of Trump by 9 points. According to a late September ABC/Washington Post poll, Biden is leading Trump with all women by 31 points, while Trump leads with all men by 13 points. Trump still maintains his lead with whites overall, but by a much slimmer 6 points. On issues of race and equal treatment of racial groups, the poll found that Biden leads Trump among all registered voters by 20 points.  Another ABC/Washington Post poll out of Pennsylvania found that white women favor Biden by 13 points. Trump still leads with white men there, who support Trump by 21 points. Results from an NYT/Siena College national poll out Sunday show that Biden leads among most voting groups, particularly college-educated whites, who support him over Trump by 16 points. Trump leads among non-college educated whites by 24 points.  In speeches over the summer, Trump lamented the loss of “our heritage” when defending Confederate statues torn down by Black Lives Matter protesters. For more than a month, Trump has been test-driving his housing attack on Biden by threatening that the Democrat will dispatch New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker to the suburbs. Trump denied it was because Booker is Black and claimed that he was doing so because of zoning legislation the New Jersey senator has sponsored. And his administration has repeatedly denied the existence of systemic racism.  Again, it all goes back to his base. A 2019 PRRI survey found that two-thirds (68 percent) of Trump supporters agree with the sentiment that discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against Black people and other minorities, according to results provided to POLITICO. That includes 72 percent of male Trump supporters who agree with that sentiment.  The impact: Trump’s appeals to white voters are shoring up excitement among his predominantly white and male base. But that alone may not be enough to carry him to a second term.  Biden’s support among voters of color is lower than Clinton’s at this point in the race. But he’s compensating for that with strong backing from college-educated whites. He\\'s winning over more white women — and he\\'s chipping away at Trump’s support among older white voters.  Republicans acknowledge the president’s unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and attacks on people of color could damage his electoral chances. Senate Republicans on Wednesday urged Trump to clarify his statement, a sign of their concerns that the president’s current strategy could threaten their majority.  Several social justice organizations, including the Movement for Black Lives and Color of Change, quickly rebuked the president’s comments on debate night, saying his telling the Proud Boys to “stand by” is a rallying cry to white nationalists. with the phrase.  The president’s failure to condemn white supremacists and the Proud Boys ends up amplifying such extremist groups online and helps them grow in size and impact.  \"We\\'ve seen a tremendous uptick in content involving white supremacy topics and the Proud Boys, more specifically, since the president made these comments during the debate,” said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of digital platforms for the Democracy Project at Harvard and a former policy adviser at Facebook.  And in the past four years, Ghosh said, “white supremacists, and more broadly the far right, have become a lot more impactful in online spaces.”'}\n",

That means Americans who haven\\'t completed the census can do so online through 6 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday morning (midnight in Hawaii), by phone by Thursday or mail a paper response as long as it is postmarked by Thursday. In-person census takers will conclude their work on Thursday.  Sotomayor, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was the only justice on the shorthanded, eight-member court to note her dissent. She called the harms from ending the count early “avoidable and intolerable.”  Experts, both inside and outside the agency, have expressed concern over a shortened timeframe for the constitutionally mandated count, arguing that a politically motivated, shortened timeline due to the pandemic threatened the census on two ends: both the actual enumeration and the data processing that follows.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a written dissent. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo  The count determines how approximately $1.5 trillion in federal spending is directed and how House seats are apportioned among the 50 states. The Census Bureau requested in April that Congress grant the agency a 120-day extension to statutory deadlines because of the pandemic.  The proposed deadlines would have pushed field collection until the end of October, with each state\\'s congressional districts being submitted to the president by April 30, 2021, instead of the year-end statutory deadline.  But Congress never granted the exemption, and Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham, an appointee of President Donald Trump, backed away from the requested extension. In early August, the bureau officially announced it was reversing its request for an extension and would deliver apportionment data to Trump by the end of the year, executing a replan that would end enumeration by the end of September and deliver apportionment data by the end of the year.  This infuriated community groups, municipalities and congressional Democrats, who all argued that the accelerated schedule would lead to a deeply flawed count that would reverberate over the next decade.  “Defendants could not then, and certainly cannot now, produce an accurate and complete census by the statutory deadline,” the plaintiffs in the case, which include the National Urban League, wrote in a brief to the court.  Earlier on Monday, the Census Bureau announced that it had counted 99.9 percent of American households: 66.8 percent through self-response, and 33.1 percent through nonresponse followup.  In her dissent, Sotomayor rejected an argument from the government that the count was already satisfactory. “Even a fraction of a percent of the Nation’s 140 million households amounts to hundreds of thousands of people left uncounted,” she wrote. “And significantly, the percentage of nonresponses is likely much higher among marginalized populations and in hard-to-count areas, such as rural and tribal lands.”  \"A census count delayed is a census count — and justice — denied,\" said Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, Calif., a Democrat, in a statement responding to the ruling. \"Justice Sotomayor’s dissent perceptively describes this administration’s outrageous attempts to do everything but ensure a full and fair census count.\" The city of San Jose was one of the plaintiffs.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, whose order the Supreme Court stayed, ruled last month that decennial count must continue, ordering that the schedule the Census Bureau\\'s attempt to wrap up enumeration was not feasible, and the bureau should follow the schedule the agency requested at the onset of the pandemic.  Koh and the Trump administration battled in the initial stages of the litigation, with the agency initially forging ahead trying to wrap up enumeration by Oct. 5, just days after the revised end date of Sept. 30.  Early this month, Koh, the San Jose-based Obama appointee, ordered the agency continue enumeration through the end of this month.  In the wake of her orders requiring the Census Bureau to keep seeking responses, Koh received a flurry of emails from rank-and-file census workers claiming that supervisors were pressing to wrap up the count despite her directives. Koh has repeatedly demanded explanations from the Trump administration and at one point floated holding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying one of her orders. The Commerce Department oversees the Census Bureau.  The DOJ asked the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Koh’s directives to the Census Bureau, but a three-judge panel last week unanimously rejected the administration’s bid to stop the count. The appeals judges — all Clinton appointees — did lift Koh’s order that the Commerce Department not seek to meet the year-end deadline for a count to be used to apportion House seats starting with the 2022 elections.  A report from Commerce Department\\'s Office of Inspector General in September found that the decision to accelerate the census schedule “was not made by the Census Bureau” and that it “increases the risks to obtaining a complete and accurate 2020 Census.”  “Senior career officials at the Bureau perceived that this decision resulted from the Administration no longer supporting the schedule extension, but ultimately they lacked visibility into this decision process,” the report read. “Bureau leaders continued to believe that the statutory extension was preferable, and would give the Bureau the best chance to create a high-quality, usable census.”  The Supreme Court’s order is the latest development in the legal fight over the decennial count that was thrown into havoc by the pandemic. Before rolling out the accelerated timeline, Trump asked the Census Bureau to provide apportionment counts excluding undocumented immigrants — a request that would represent a shift from previous practice and is also tied up in court from litigants who say it is unconstitutional.  A separate panel of judges blocked that memorandum in September, which has also been appealed by the government to the Supreme Court.'}\n",

But if there is a clear winner on election night, it’ll almost certainly be bad news for Trump.  “The reason [Barrett’s nomination is ] so exciting to Republicans is the uncertainty about what’s going to happen on Nov. 3. Here there is certainty that … we can get this across the finish line,” said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who introduced Barrett at her confirmation hearing on Monday. “There’s so much uncertainty politically, not only associated with the election, and also what can we agree on” for stimulus.  Braun said the Barrett confirmation would be a cornerstone of Trump’s legacy in his first term. Some of his colleagues are increasingly worried there won’t be a second term, and that Trump\\'s trajectory threatens their majority as well.  “It’s a trend and it’s going in the wrong direction,” said one Republican senator of Trump’s polling. “I think Republicans have a better chance of keeping the Senate than Donald Trump has of winning the election.”  Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) slammed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during a Saturday conference call to discuss the $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal they floated to Pelosi, saying it would be “the death knell for our majority if Pelosi gets this win,” according to sources on the call.  When asked Monday about her concerns with the White House’s position on the Covid relief talks, Blackburn said she instead backed a $300 billion bill crafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Democrats blocked debate on that measure a month ago, rejecting it as way too little to help the slumping U.S. economy.  “I like the package that we had on the floor,” Blackburn told reporters following the first day of Barrett’s confirmation hearings. “It was the right approach.”  Blackburn, however, denied there was any serious divide with Trump or the White House.  “There is a lot that we agree on and we’re going to do just fine this week,” the Tennessee Republican said following the first day of hearings on Barrett’s nomination. Blackburn serves on the Judiciary Committee.  With calls for more help coming from Trump, business leaders and average Americans, Senate Republicans are discussing possibly holding a vote on another GOP aid bill next week, a reflection that the party needs to show it’s still trying to address the biggest crisis in the country, according to people familiar with internal party discussions. Democrats have rejected any piecemeal legislation, and Republicans have tried to shift the blame onto them for the long delay in a new coronavirus assistance package, though Pelosi first passed another bill in May.  “Once you take a look at the things Nancy Pelosi is promoting, both in terms of the price and the policy, we have a lot of concerns about that,” Senate Republican Conference Chair John Barrasso of Wyoming said in an interview on Monday. “But we’ve put forth what we thought was a good faith effort, and [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and the Democrats voted no, every one of them. ... We’re united on that.”  Of course, after Republicans spent the day attacking Democrats for obstructing a smaller bill, Trump turned his attention to his own party on Twitter: \"Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!\"  Yet Trump has only limited influence in the legislative sphere and his sinking political fortunes are further undercutting his agenda. The president seems to pay little heed to what’s happening on Capitol Hill on a daily basis, but then will claim that a major health care or tax cut package is going to be heading to his desk soon, despite the fact that nothing of the kind is even being considered by Congress.  Trump’s current political standing seems to have hurt his ability to persuade Senate Republicans to embrace more deficit spending. Some on Saturday’s conference call between Senate Republicans, Mnuchin and Meadows saw the frosty reception for the senior administration officials as a reflection of a party becoming less and less deferential to the president.  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted “Senate Republicans will ultimately come along with what the president wants.” But if it’s anything close to the $1.8 trillion discussed by the Trump administration and Democrats, Braun surmised: “I can’t vote for it.”  “The only ones who will come up looking good at it are the Democrats,” said Braun, who criticized proposals to send undocumented immigrants stimulus checks and expand some Obamacare coverage.  Even the handling of Barrett’s nomination became a point of contention between Senate Republicans and Trump on Monday. Within minutes of the hearing’s start, Trump essentially demanded that his party fast-forward through the planned four days of hearings and confirm her, and then immediately pass a relief bill.  “The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!” Trump tweeted.  The Judiciary panel’s chair, Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose South Carolina Senate seat is now vulnerable due to his alliance with Trump, quickly brushed off the Trump’s comments.  “With all due respect to the president, the committee is following the traditions of the committee,” Graham said. “It’s good for the country to have this hearing.”  Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.'}\n",

Driving the Day  MCCONNELL LINES UP SENATE VOTE ON SKINNY AID PACKAGE: The Senate will vote next week on another slimmed-down package from Republican leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.  What’s in the bill: The $500 billion package would provide more money for the Paycheck Protection Program, which helped small businesses pay employees during the pandemic, and some extra unemployment aid, though it’s unclear what form that would take. It would also enact coronavirus infection liability protections for businesses and send more cash to hospitals, among other things.  Big picture: The measure is a far cry from the nearly $2 trillion bill Democrats had demanded, and nearly as far from the $1.8 trillion compromise the White House — over Republican objections — had offered them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already denounced the package.  MORE: “McConnell dares Democrats to block 'targeted' Covid relief before election,” from our Burgess Everett and Sarah Ferris  Supreme Court  SCOTUS GIVES TRUMP OK TO CEASE CENSUS COUNT: “The Supreme Court has cleared the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to end enumeration for the decennial census early, blocking a lower court order that required the government to continue with the count as originally planned through the end of October,” our Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein report.  BACKGROUND: “After initially claiming it required an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration switched gears this summer and said it would end enumeration a month early, by Sept. 30, so it could produce census data for apportionment of congressional districts for the next decade by the end of the year.” SCOTUS’ move clears an obstacle to one of President Donald Trump’s major immigration goals.  STATE OF PLAY: Trump instructed the Census Bureau in July to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count for the purpose of congressional reapportionment — a request that is separately tied up in court from litigants who say it is unconstitutional. Last month, a separate panel of judges blocked that memo.  But the Department of Justice has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that “expedited consideration” is needed due to fast-approaching statutory deadlines. The Commerce secretary must deliver the census data to the president by Dec. 31, and the president in turn must give apportionment counts to Congress by Jan. 10, 2021. (More details on that from Zach.)  As our Steven Shepard has noted, the new, shorter timeline provided for by Tuesday’s ruling could allow the Trump administration to finalize the census count — and exclude undocumented immigrants, if granted a favorable ruling by SCOTUS — before the inauguration of a President Joe Biden.  In the States  CALIFORNIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MEASURE UNLIKELY TO PASS IN NOVEMBER: Polls are showing that Californians are likely to reject Proposition 16, a state ballot measure that would allow an applicant’s race and gender to be considered in public college admissions and public-sector hiring, our Alexander Nieves reports.  “The surprising mood of the California electorate is confounding state lawmakers and political strategists, who believe the moment is riper than ever to repeal” a 1996 ban on affirmative action, Alexander writes. “A defeat now could delay the return of affirmative action for years, squandering a 2020 opportunity with racial justice top of mind for voters across the U.S.”  NEW YORK WINS SUIT OVER TRUSTED TRAVELER PROGRAM: A federal judge handed Gov. Andrew Cuomo a victory in his long-running fight with the Trump administration over a prohibition on New Yorkers enrolling in expedited border-crossing programs, our Bill Mahoney reports.  Although DHS ended the ban in July, Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman wrote in an opinion issued Tuesday that the move was “unlawful” from the get-go and that it should be vacated to “ensure that it cannot be reinstated.”  BACKGROUND: “The Department of Homeland Security imposed the prohibition in February, saying that New York’s new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses made it impossible to properly vet applicants to the programs,” Bill writes.  Around the Agencies  SCALIA’S WIFE TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19: Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia’s wife, Trish, tested positive for coronavirus Tuesday afternoon, DOL announced in an email Tuesday night, and “is experiencing mild symptoms but doing well.” The Labor Secretary tested negative on Tuesday evening, according to DOL, and “has experienced no symptoms.”  Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and his wife Trish walk by the Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020, in Washington. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik  Scalia and his wife, as well as his mother, Maureen, were in the second row during a Rose Garden event for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Sept. 26 that was also attended by at least 10 people who later tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Washington Post. “All three also were inside the White House for a private reception with Trump and Barrett.”  2020 Watch  BIDEN REVIVES FIZZLED ‘BUY AMERICAN’ HOPES: The Democratic presidential nominee is attempting to do for American manufacturing what Trump could not, our Doug Palmer reports.  The plan: “Biden hopes to win back blue-collar voters who deserted Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election with a four-year plan to spend $400 billion on federal government purchases of an array of American-made goods,” Doug writes. “Biden also promises to invest another $300 billion to develop technologies like electric vehicles, 5G networks and artificial intelligence.”  The goal: “The two initiatives will help create at least 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation, the Biden campaign contends. If realized, that would boost manufacturing jobs to around 17 million, a level not seen in the United States since the early 2000s.”  In the Workplace  LAB STAFF SHORTAGES SLOW COVID TESTS: “As the U.S. has processed more than 1 million daily Covid-19 tests four times in the past week, the demands placed on laboratories are exacerbating longstanding staffing shortages,” Brianna Abbott reports for The Wall Street Journal. Now, some laboratories are “hiring traveling laboratory scientists, investing in automation and sometimes flexing schedules or raising salaries.”  “Laboratories that don’t have adequate staff sometimes have to limit the amount of testing they can do, which can force them to reduce the types of tests they offer,” Abbott reports. “The shortages could also extend turnaround time for test results.”  COMPANIES PUSH BACK RETURN TO OFFICE: More and more white-collar companies are delaying when their employees can go back to working in-person until the summer of 2021, The New York Times’ Gillian Friedman and Kellen Browning report.  “Google was one of the first to announce that July 2021 was its return-to-office date. Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon jumped on the bandwagon. In the past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor and The New York Times said they, too, had postponed the return of in-person work to next summer and acknowledged the inevitable: The pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon.”  Immigration  STATE DEPARTMENT HOLDS BACK SOME REFUGEE DATA: The State Department last week ceased releasing some statistics on refugees admitted to the U.S., including data on their religious beliefs, Religion News Service’s Emily McFarlan Miller and Jack Jenkins reports.  A spokesperson said the changes were due to “the development of a new information technology system, which won’t be completed until December 2021, and concerns about privacy,” they write.  “The shift has raised concerns from at least one of the faith-based organizations tasked with resettling refugees in the country. The data helped groups such as World Relief track whether the federal government is living up to its pledges to help those facing religious persecution.”  MORE: “U.S. Agents Returned Migrants to Honduras in Unauthorized Operation, Senate Report Says,” from The Wall Street Journal  — “Department Of Homeland Security Employees Have Been Told To Report Colleagues Suspected Of Leaking Information,” from BuzzFeed News  What We're Reading  — “24 hours in the life of American workers,” from The Washington Post  — “Theater Chain AMC Says It Could Run Out of Cash by Year-End,” from The Wall Street Journal  —“Thousands of Amazon workers demand time off to vote,” from NBC News  — “The seasonal job is getting a makeover and, in many cases, a pay raise,” from The Washington Post  — “Biden’s son-in-law advises campaign on pandemic while investing in Covid-19 startups,” from POLITICO  — “Google Employees Are Free to Speak Up.

But in recent weeks the vast Southern Tier is emerging as a concern , particularly notable because it was largely spared from the worst of the outbreak seen this spring.  On Tuesday, the region, which spans much of New York's border with Pennsylvania, recorded an infection rate of just under 24 new cases per 100,000 people on a seven-day rolling average. For reference, that’s more than double the 10 per 100,000 cut off for states that New York officials consider dangerous enough to get on the tri-state travel quarantine list.  Aside from New York City and surrounding clusters, the Southern Tier is the only other region in the state to have a color-coded danger zone : Broome County was designated a yellow “precautionary zone” last week. The uptick is striking, because the Southern Tier was one of the first regions cleared to begin reopening businesses this spring. And with less trauma from the initial impact earlier this year, it’s more difficult to convince residents of the importance of enhanced precautions now necessary to control the spread.  Overall, New York’s tests still come back around a 1 percent positivity rate —- though that ticked up to 1.4 on Tuesday. And hospitalizations on Tuesday hit 923, the highest point since June 25, according to state data .  The governor has repeatedly said that the nation is only at “halftime” when it comes to battling Covid-19. Looks like New York could be heading out of the locker room soon.  IT’S WEDNESDAY.

WHAT CITY HALL'S READING  WITH NATIONAL FOCUS on the presidential election, the race to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio kicked into high gear Tuesday night as seven candidates took questions on policing, real estate and economic recovery in the first public forum of the 2021 contest. The candidates, who span the ideological spectrum, found some common ground: They each vowed to replace de Blasio’s police chief, Dermot Shea, who caught flak for his handling of nightly police reform protests earlier this year, following the Minneapolis killing of George Floyd. They all promised to stay out of the City Council speaker’s race — a departure from de Blasio, who used his newfound influence in 2013 to position his favored legislator to win the powerful post, which is intended to serve as a check on mayors. And to varying degrees, they all questioned his expansive real estate agenda and unsuccessful plan for an Amazon headquarters in Queens, which would have created at least 25,000 jobs over a decade but triggered opposition in part for its reliance on large tax breaks and its end-run around a public review process. POLITICO’s Sally Goldenberg and Joe Anuta  “COVID-19 HAS put the MTA in such a dire financial hole that one in every four dollars the agency brings in next year will go to paying off its mountain of debt, says a report released Tuesday by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Historically low use of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s trains, buses, bridges and tunnels has dug a $10.3 billion budget hole through the end of 2023 — and it’s not clear whether the agency will get relief from Congress to cover its losses. DiNapoli said the pandemic — which has so far killed at least 131 transit employees — is the greatest crisis in the MTA’s 55-year history. ‘The MTA desperately needs an influx of federal funds or unheard of service cuts and workforce reductions will happen,’ said DiNapoli. ‘Failure to fund the MTA now could disrupt maintenance and repairs and increase the MTA’s debt to suffocating levels that could take multiple generations to recover from.’” New York Daily News’ Clayton Guse  — While only 30 percent of riders have returned to the subway system as a whole since the onset of the pandemic in March, many subway stations in Brooklyn and Queens have recovered at least half of their usual ridership.  — “In May, as the city continued to fight to keep down its coronavirus infection rate, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed transit experts to a Surface Transportation Advisory Council. ‘These councils will provide real world guidance to ensure our plans to reopen the city make sense and keep people safe,’ de Blasio said in a release. The transportation experts submitted a long list of ideas to the mayor this summer. Among the suggestions: aggressively expand street space for pedestrians and ramp up bike lane installation with the goal of doubling ridership; come up with a plan for restricting vehicular traffic in Manhattan like the city did after 9/11, ‘should traffic congestion surge’; and come up with a ‘robust communications plan’ to help New Yorkers get out of their cars and find other ways to get around. The de Blasio administration did not respond to the panel.” Gothamist’s Christopher Robbins  “HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL children appeared suddenly on the rainy streets of Borough Park on Tuesday morning. With backpacks in tow, they walked from stoops to yellow school buses, disembarking outside the propped open doors and back entrances of the neighborhood's yeshivas. They moved quickly, heeding the warnings they'd been given to arrive on time or be turned away. Facing an uptick in coronavirus test rates, Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated last week that roughly 300 public and private schools inside nine hotspot zones transition to all-remote learning. Newly-reopened public schools, some of which don't have any confirmed cases of the virus, reluctantly complied. But many private yeshivas are spurning the shutdown order in the ultra-Orthodox stronghold of Borough Park, home to one of the highest infection rates in the city, Gothamist has learned. According to one parent, nearly all of the private yeshivas in the neighborhood have ignored Cuomo's closing order.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz and Scott Heins  NEW YORK CITY has begun to see a “leveling off” in coronavirus infection rates in some hotspot neighborhoods, following a weekend enforcement blitz that doled out $150,000 in fines to violators of new shutdown rules. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday there are early indications that a new round of restrictions, which took effect last week in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, are having an effect. “We are seeing some results. We’ve got, certainly, a lot of work ahead. We are seeing some leveling off beginning in the communities that have been most affected,” de Blasio told reporters. Shutdowns took effect on Thursday under a decree from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said nonessential businesses must close, houses of worship can only host 10 people, and all gatherings are banned in red zones where the worst clusters of Covid-19 have occurred. Lesser restrictions apply in orange and yellow zones surrounding the worst outbreaks. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin  — There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases across multiple neighborhoods on Staten Island, with five zip codes seeing a test positivity rate more than 2 percent.  — It’s unclear whether early voting sites will be able to operate in neighborhoods with Covid-19-inspired restrictions.  “THE NYPD’s highest-ranking Hispanic officer, Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo, resigned from his position after weeks of tension with Mayor de Blasio, police sources said Tuesday. Pichardo, 43, was named Chief of Patrol less than a year ago, after serving as No. 2 for Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison when Harrison held that position. The NYPD confirmed that he put in his retirement papers, but sources tell the Daily News that City Hall officials are pleading with him to reconsider. The tipping point came after last week’s Orthodox Jewish protests in Borough Park, sources said. Pichardo worked 36 hours straight on Wednesday and Thursday, then went home to fall asleep and missed a call from the mayor, the sources said. When he woke up, he returned the call. But Hizzoner summoned him to City Hall Friday to give him a tongue lashing for not answering the phone, the sources said.” New York Daily News’ Thomas Tracy, Graham Rayman, Rocco Parascandola and John Annese  — The NYPD created a committee to “reimagine” its policing, in line with a mandate from Cuomo to police departments across the state.  — Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, is leaving her post by the end of the month.

Cuomo’s noted, more than once, that the book is not a signal that the pandemic is over, but a retelling of the height of the crisis in New York, where the virus has killed more than 33,000. The book, titled ‘American Crisis,’ is Cuomo’s attempt to convince readers that New York formed a competent response to the pandemic, while characterizing President Donald Trump and his administration as careless and dismissive to the virus. ‘Trump did more to hurt us than to help us,’ Cuomo writes. ‘Anytime there was a function that needed to be performed by government, Trump instinctively withdrew.’” New York Now’s Dan Clark  “OVER THE PAST DECADE, more than 700 reviews of child deaths in New York were kept hidden by a state agency , decisions denying the public answers about whether Child Protective Services (CPS) workers failed those children. The most recent suppression stems from an unusually high-profile case: The January death of Thomas Valva, the autistic 8-year-old who had allegedly been beaten by his father, then forced to sleep in a freezing garage in Suffolk County, Long Island, where he froze to death. By law, after the death of a child in the CPS system, the state Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) must create a report examining whether CPS workers followed required protocols in investigating allegations of abuse that had been reported prior to the fatality. But OCFS has discretion about whether to release the resulting report, and often employs an exemption that blocks disclosure — a step the agency has taken in the Valva case. ‘I’m just flabbergasted that they would take a position like that,’ said attorney Jon Norinsberg, who is representing Thomas Valva’s mother in a negligence case against Suffolk County.” Times Union’s Chris Bragg  “BUFFALO POLICE have released body camera footage of New York State Supreme Court Justice Mark Grisanti shoving an officer after a fight with his neighbor, then invoking his friendship with the mayor and family ties to law enforcement, before successfully avoiding arrest. Police said Grisanti was drunk at the time. Law360 obtained the videos of the police detaining Grisanti and his wife late last week through a Freedom of Information Law request. The profanity-laced footage reveals in detail that the state senator-turned-judge used physical force against police and justified it, repeatedly threatened officers, and touted his political connections... In the video, Justice Grisanti is seen charging toward and shoving an officer trying to arrest his wife as the officer threw her down on their front lawn after she refused to stop screaming. The judge was restrained by a second officer but repeatedly demanded his wife's release, while listing his close connections to powerful people in Buffalo, notably his ‘good friend’ Mayor Byron Brown and ‘cousin’ Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia.” Law360’s Frank G.

Andrew Cuomo a victory in his long-running fight with the Trump administration over a prohibition on New Yorkers enrolling in expedited border crossing programs. The Department of Homeland Security imposed the prohibition in February, saying that New York’s new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses made it impossible to properly vet applicants to the programs. But DHS decided to end the ban in July when it was forced to admit that it had made false claims in court filings. Officials had justified their actions by saying that New York’s decision to block federal agencies from obtaining DMV records was unique; several other states actually impose similar rules. In the opinion released on Tuesday, Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman wrote that the federal decision was “unlawful” from the get-go and that it should be vacated to “ensure that it cannot be reinstated.” “The decision was plainly arbitrary and capricious,” he wrote. POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney  “THE SUPREME COURT has cleared the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to end enumeration for the decennial census early, blocking a lower court order that required the government to continue with the count as originally planned through the end of October. The high court’s order Tuesday granting the Justice Department’s request for an emergency stay offered no explanation for the decision, which required the support of at least five justices. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a written dissent. After initially claiming it required an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration switched gears this summer and said it would end enumeration a month early, by Sept. 30, so it could produce census data for apportionment of congressional districts for the next decade by the end of the year. Sotomayor, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was the only justice on the shorthanded, eight-member court to note her dissent. She called the harms from ending the count early ‘avoidable and intolerable.’” POLITICO’s Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein  ... 2020 VISION ...  “THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH Coalition is dropping a massive ad buy and launching an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort to assist Rep.

GALVIN SLAMS COURT CENSUS DECISION — The Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald Trump\\'s administration to wrap up the U.S. Census early , leaving some officials in Massachusetts worried that residents will go uncounted.  The once-in-a-decade count was slated to wrap up at the end of October. But the court ruled on Tuesday that Trump can end the census count now, about two weeks early. Census officials plan to wrap up the enumeration on Thursday, which means census-takers can submit their information over the phone or online by the end of the day tomorrow, or mail in their response as long as it is postmarked by Oct. 15.  What that means for the count in Massachusetts is not entirely clear. Census officials say the response rate in Massachusetts is 99.9%. But Secretary of State Bill Galvin says that number is \"an obvious fiction.\" The census was initially slated to end July 31, but was extended due to the pandemic.  \"I don\\'t know what Wilbur Ross is smoking, but it must be good,\" Galvin quipped after seeing the numbers, in a reference to the Commerce secretary, according to a MassLive.com report.  Galvin\\'s office had been preparing to make a final push this weekend with local leaders in undercounted cities and towns to urge residents to take the census.  “This decision by the Supreme Court to allow the Trump Administration to stop the census count early is going to shortchange Massachusetts,\" Galvin said in a statement to POLITICO. \"Allowing the Trump Administration to stop the count now will leave those residents uncounted for the next ten years. Certainly, the phrase \\'stop the count\\' coming from this administration is a chilling one, as we head into November.”  It\\'s likely that students, immigrants and people in urban communities are being undercounted, according to state Rep. Paul Mark, who chairs the House Committee on Redistricting. The impact of undercounting residents is twofold, Mark said. The census count impacts the way districts are drawn and how political power is allotted on the state and federal levels. And a higher census count means more state and federal funding for cities and towns.  \"Before Covid, the estimate was every person that doesn\\'t fill out the census costs their community almost $2,400 a year for the next 10 years,\" Mark said. \"With the response to a crisis that could continue for we don\\'t know how long, I think those numbers can only can only go up.\"  Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

The real problem lies with the way both parties have learned to weaponize the Supreme Court to lock in their own policy preferences and to hang on to partisan influence—a story that goes back before McConnell’s current rushed hearings, before the Republicans in the Senate blocked Merrick Garland, and long before Democrats in the Senate blocked Robert Bork.  And, although Americans don’t like to think about it this way, the root of the difficulty lies with the Constitution itself—whose authors failed to anticipate that parties would eventually dominate the system the way they do, and to depend on ideologically friendly judges more than the support of voters. As Amy Coney Barrett sits in a Senate hearing room this week, it’s also the Constitution itself that is on trial—and showing its cracks.  There’s no provision anywhere in the Constitution to prevent total partisan takeovers of one or more of the branches of government. The framers wanted to build an effective national government while creating institutional roadblocks to stymie the excesses of democracy, but their theory of tyranny was simplistic. They worried that one faction could control more than one branch of government, and their design choice for dealing with that problem was fairly tepid: separate functions, harness self-interest to counteract self-interest and hope for the best. The idea of ideological fairness, or partisan balance, that seems to motivate many Americans today wasn’t part of the framers’ thinking. This was because partisan dysfunction wasn’t a problem they had thought through carefully.  If it had been, they could have established explicit rules about the makeup of the court, say, by limiting the number of justices any particular president could appoint, by establishing term limits, or by lodging the selection power in some nonpartisan body. In fact, the framers thought the biggest risk to liberty was the Congress, and couldn’t imagine that the judiciary would ever grow out of its role as “the least dangerous branch.” As a result, they said very little about what they expected judges to do beyond construe a written constitution and apply statutes.  Their major blind spot was not anticipating the problems created by political parties. Early parties were not national in nature and didn’t seek to police ideological discipline to the same degree as modern parties. A politics driven by national parties created fresh problems because every organization has an imperative; a party seeks to seize control of existing levers of power and impose its worldviews on the rest of the country.  A president wanting a nominee who will approve his policies is certainly nothing new. In 1801, John Adams’ appointment of John Marshall to the Supreme Court after Thomas Jefferson’s contested presidential victory aimed to preserve the gains of the Federalist Party. Since then, it’s the sheer scale and means of partisan entrenchment that have changed. Along the way, the rise of the Supreme Court’s power to strike down unconstitutional laws, famously defended by Chief Justice Marshall, has exacerbated partisan dysfunction rather than corrected for it. The court’s move to the center of America’s cultural life has opened up new opportunities for partisan gamesmanship, while fooling too many citizens that such outsize influence should never be scrutinized.  Despite conservative hand-wringing about “activist judges” expanding rights, for most of American history federal courts have stood in the way of human rights, such as when the Supreme Court shut down civil rights laws right after Reconstruction, prolonging segregation for decades, or when it approved the removal of Japanese Americans to internment camps during the Second World War. The most notable exception was the Warren court years of the 1950s and ’60s, when the justices entrenched liberal ideas such as expanded rights for the accused and the separation of church and state.  The Warren court’s activism actually caused two long-term problems, both of which contributed to the SCOTUS wars. One is that having the court codify policies, especially in the absence of a true national consensus, sometimes led to backlash that ultimately eroded those gains—even while leaving in place the myth that courts always help the little guy or consistently interpret the Constitution correctly.  The other problem is that both parties now see the courts as the best way to push their longer-term cultural goals. In the days of the Warren court, conservatives argued that the power of judges needed to be reined in: Relying on judges to lock in important culture-war victories like the right to abortion was essentially anti-democratic. Indeed, this was the central message of the “Impeach Earl Warren” movement. The natural solution, they argued, should be to reduce the influence of the courts and return debates back to the people.  No longer. Today, the GOP is all-in on the tactics of legal liberalism to dismantle the constitutional achievements of those with whom they disagree. Instead of trying to get rid of judicially created rights, conservatives focused on persuading judges to establish new rights or expand those rights favored by conservatives, such as the right of corporations to engage in free speech or the right of religious employers to opt out of civil rights laws. That strategy is best encapsulated by the Federalist Society, the national networking group that both grooms and offers a seal of approval of “originalist” judges who can reliably be counted on to help dismantle the administrative state, uphold voting restrictions on voting rights, and impede progressive goals such as national health care.  The GOP’s decision to double down on the courts, rather than chip away at their power, has paid off with monumental decisions like DC v. Heller, won in the Supreme Court, which recognized an individual right to bear arms for the first time. But it has also raised expectations that further control of the judiciary was the key to wins on big national policy issues such as rolling back regulation of weapons, obliterating the right to reproductive autonomy, expanding religious freedoms in the public square, increasing access to public funds for religious groups, and stemming the rights of sexual minorities. Ideological domination of the judiciary, rather than intellectual or partisan balance, or winning seats in Congress, would be the key to this transformation.  There’s another reason the Supreme Court wars have become so intense: changes to the parties themselves. As the GOP’s big-tent strategy of the 1980s has turned into appeals to a smaller slice of America, the party has found it harder to win a national majority in an increasingly diverse country—and so controlling key levers like the judiciary (and the Electoral College) have become crucial to its ability to govern.  At this very moment, a president who came to power without earning the majority support of Americans has doubled down on the courts as a major part of his efforts to stay in office, hoping that a conservative court will rule his way in any electoral dispute. Much of the blame for that can be laid at the feet of the court itself, which ended the disputed 2000 election in Bush v. Gore by stopping the recount in Florida. In doing so, it opened the floodgates to election-related lawsuits and increased the odds that a party could retain power even though it loses the popular vote.  That precedent looms large in Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting and other measures in lawsuits around the country. The president and his allies have admitted they are rushing to fill the position left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death “to stop the ballots,” betraying the degree to which the party has come to rely on judicial power to retain political power. As Senator Lindsey Graham said the other day, “[I]f the Supreme Court decides that Joe Biden wins, I will accept the result. The court will decide, and if Republicans lose, we’ll accept the result.” That is not how the founders envisioned choosing a president.  Democrats, however, have also continued to depend on the courts to enhance their political fortunes: notably, when it comes to striking down restrictions on immigration and abortion, which are popular with that party’s base, even though most Americans have complicated views on these issues. On racial equality and LGBTQ rights, judges have been rendering parsimonious interpretations of the Constitution for decades, but the occasional high-profile victory in the courts (e.g., forbidding racially separate schools, decriminalizing sex between gay people, or establishing same-sex marriage) has been enough to satisfy Democrats rather than convincing them of the need to agitate for new laws that can deal with a broad range of inequities. These trends, more than anything else, have turned Supreme Court nominations into a zero-sum game.  The stakes are now simply too high. Both sides have been deeply invested in the courts, albeit for a slightly different set of reasons.  What can be done about it? In the broadest sense, our periodic agonizing over individual judges has also papered over the fact that we are long overdue for a convention where we can finally modernize our Constitution, rather than continue to engage in increasingly ridiculous debates over the meaning of words (or their absence) in an 18th-century document.  In the nearer term, there’s no magic bullet, and no shortage of proposals to alter the size of the Supreme Court or reduce its jurisdiction.  Today, it makes sense to pay more attention to the ideological range of the federal judiciary than the framers did, and to consider how far out of step the institution can get from the actual beliefs of living Americans—especially if popular acceptance of its rulings matters to us in a way it never did for the homogeneous group deeply skeptical of democracy that authored the 1787 Constitution. As a population, we are more diverse, fractious and cynical about government than ever before. Our needs as a society are unquestionably different from those who lived even a generation ago, never mind 240 years ago. A Supreme Court that’s simply an adjunct to one political party and can obstruct the policies of the majority for too long will accelerate America’s democratic decline. To revive our sense of what politics can accomplish, we have to break our cycle of dependency on judges.  In the short run, though, the incentives for unilateral deescalation are nonexistent. If you act in disciplined fashion while your opponent acknowledges no restraints, you simply get rolled. What we need is a temporary truce forged by statesmen that can lay down some rules of engagement, with clear consequences for breaches. Only when that happens can the more lasting work be done: figuring out how to reform an institution that has become little more than the extension of party politics.  '}\n",

They are strictly prohibited by the State Department, which provides their funding and oversees their efforts, from conducting direct enforcement operations in countries abroad.  “Still, last January, alarm bells went off in Washington when a group of Honduran migrants from the northern city of San Pedro Sula began crossing the Honduras-Guatemala border, with hopes of reaching the U.S. and asking for asylum. U.S. Customs and Border Protection rented three buses and set off to halt the caravan’s progress, according to the report. Together with Guatemalan border authorities, U.S. agents halted the migrants and loaded them onto buses, which then returned them to the border with Honduras, the review states.” WSJ  YIKES … WUSA9: “Virginia voter registration down on last day to register to vote before election,” by Khalida Volou and Jonathan Franklin: “An accidentally cut cable has caused the entire Virginia voter registration system to go down on the last day to register to vote before election day.

Its first digital ad, set to run in Michigan and Pennsylvania, takes sharp aim at Trump’s claim to a foothold with Christians.

He is only the third person to occupy what is perhaps the most powerful intelligence role ever created, a so-called ‘dual hat’ in government parlance.

We can now all relive the past six months through the eyes of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, if that’s your particular cup of tea. (Looking at you, Cuomo Stan social media accounts.)  The governor made the rounds over the long weekend for the second volume he’s written while in office, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,” which is being officially released today. It’s largely a compilation of more than one hundred days of regular briefings this year and another hundred of intermittent addresses. He’s thrown in some gems, such the time he left a bottle of branded NYS Clean hand sanitizer on President Donald Trump’s desk after a meeting in the Oval Office this spring.  The book’s release, just three weeks from Election Day, has earned criticism that Cuomo is taking a “victory lap” while New York is seeing rising infection rates in certain neighborhoods . And it’s accompanied by a sweeping New Yorker profile where some describe his “leadership lessons” as more closely resembling exercises in tyranny.  Cuomo\\'s book has also reignited talk of his future, particularly if longtime ally Joe Biden were to clinch the presidency next month.  To the first critique, Cuomo told CBS during an interview with his daughters on Sunday a version of his standard line — the book is a roadmap for fending off the coronavirus’s continued advances rather than a braggart’s account of success: “There’s no victory here, the game isn’t over... Let’s learn the lesson from the first half of the game and play a better second half.”  To the chatter about his stepping stones — and rumors that he could be in talks for the U.S. attorney general spot — Cuomo told NBC’s “Today” show that he would help Biden in any way he can, but he has “no interest in going to Washington .\" The rumors “are only from people who want to get me out of New York. I don’t know why, but that’s where that’s coming from.”  But Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo, during the CBS interview, did not indicate that talks of Cuomo going to Washington were entirely absent from the dinner table: “I like Dad being in New York. He really likes it here. But, as someone who wishes that I had someone I could vote for who would be more inspiring and someone who seems more competent... if that were Dad, I\\'d be a really grateful and proud American.

Holding a media availability and speaking at the New York Building Congress’ Virtual Construction Outlook Week Breakfast.  QUOTE OF THE DAY: “He’s inclined toward tyranny. But in a crisis that’s what people want.” — A Democratic legislator quoted in The New Yorker’s new Cuomo profile  ABOVE THE FOLD: “GOV. ANDREW M. CUOMO had barely finished a fairly routine coronavirus briefing earlier this month when he got word that the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, had just blindsided him. The mayor unexpectedly announced that he intended to close down schools and nonessential businesses in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, where the coronavirus was surging in communities with large Orthodox Jewish populations. Mr. de Blasio asserted that he had been in contact with the state, whose approval was needed. It took less than 24 hours for Mr. Cuomo to fire back . He halted the mayor’s plan to shutter businesses, calling it imprecise and incomplete, and sped up the closure of schools. By the next day, the governor unveiled his own plan: another phased-in lockdown, complete with color-coded maps and a barely veiled message for Mr. de Blasio.” New York Times’ Jesse McKinley, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Dana Rubinstein and Joseph Goldstein  A message from Uber: CA voters & app workers voted overwhelmingly to protect workers’ flexibility and provide new benefits. Time for New York to follow, see how here.      WHAT CITY HALL\\'S READING  “A FEDERAL JUDGE on Friday allowed Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to move forward with new restrictions on gatherings at synagogues and other houses of worship, finding that the rules did not violate the free exercise of religion for Orthodox Jews. The ruling in federal court in Brooklyn came after Agudath Israel of America, a national Orthodox Jewish organization, sued Mr. Cuomo this week over his latest executive order detailing an array of new restrictions to address rising coronavirus cases in neighborhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews....The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn filed a similar lawsuit against Mr. Cuomo, arguing that the restrictions would effectively force at least two dozen churches in Brooklyn and Queens to close. After a separate hearing on Friday, a different judge also declined to block the executive order.” New York Times’ Nicole Hong and Liam Stack  — “New York authorities have dished out over $150,000 in penalties since Friday in the city’s new coronavirus hot zones, including five fines for religious gatherings, according to officials. Some 62 fines have been dispensed under the new crackdown in Brooklyn and Queens, according to a Sunday afternoon post on the city’s official Twitter account. The six-figure sum represents a different approach compared to a recent, far more anemic stab at enforcement by the city. City sources noted that five of the fines — for the maximum allowable penalty of $15,000 a piece — were issued to the organizers of Orthodox religious gatherings in Borough Park, Brooklyn that each drew hundreds of people.” New York Post’s Joe Marino and Aaron Feis  — “Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox congregants attended an indoor prayer service in Borough Park on Friday in open defiance of Governor Andrew Cuomo newly imposed restrictions on religious gatherings in COVID hotspots. The service was led by a prominent rabbi who tested positive for coronavirus one week ago, multiple sources told Gothamist.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz  “POLICE ARRESTED radio personality and anti-masker Heshy Tischler outside his Borough Park home on Sunday for allegedly instigating an attack on an Orthodox journalist. Citing his role in egging on a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews in an attack of a Hasidic journalist on Oct. 7, cops charged Tischler with inciting a riot and unlawful imprisonment, according to police. The 56-year-old vocal coronavirus denier organized two demonstrations in Borough Park on Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 against Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s new COVID-19 regulations. The new rules, which went into effect last week, closed schools and limited religious gatherings to 10 people in New York City coronavirus hotspots... A large crowd egged on by Tischler chased down and attacked well-known Orthodox journalist Jacob Kornbluh, a veteran reporter for Jewish Insider who has written about attempts to flout social distancing guidelines in Borough Park.” Brooklyn Paper’s Rose Adams  — The protest organizer was released Monday night and ordered to stay away from Kornbluh. A group of protesters demonstrated outside the journalist’s home after the arrest.  “THE NUMBER OF people held in New York City jails has dropped steadily under Mayor Bill de Blasio, and it continued to fall this year as the city emptied out its jails to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But there is one number at Rikers Island and the city’s other jails that has held constant in the last three years, despite the mayor’s strenuous efforts to reduce it: the tally of people in solitary confinement. Even as the jail population dropped, correction officials have relied on solitary confinement to punish about the same number of inmates each year since 2017, records show. And that trend continued in the first six months of this year as the jails released hundreds of people because of the pandemic.” New York Times’ Jan Ransom  “BROADWAY THEATERS will remain dark through May 30, 2021, because of the coronavirus pandemic, the industry’s trade group said Friday. ‘Our membership is committed to reopening as soon as conditions permit us to do so,’ said Broadway League President Charlotte St. Martin. The theaters clustered in the heart of New York City closed on March 12, at the onset of the pandemic. It was expected initially that they would be able to welcome patrons back within weeks, but the League said over the summer that the shutdown would continue through early January.” Wall Street Journal’s Charles Passy  — Some smaller theaters want to resume performances sooner, saying they are better set up to allow socially distanced seating.      WHAT ALBANY\\'S READING  THE LEFTWARD turn in New York’s suburbs, which enabled Democrats to win a historic majority in the state Senate in 2018, has dominated discussions among political observers in the last few years. But another trend, which has gone unnoticed, also helped remake the Legislature in 2018 . Republicans managed to oust three incumbents that year, and these three had something in common: Each represented a district where there were more registered Republicans than Democrats. That left Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, who has represented a district that includes Saratoga Springs and 14 mostly rural towns for three terms, as the only one of the 147 Democrats in the 213-member Legislature to represent a district with a Republican plurality.  And this year, Woerner is facing arguably the most aggressive challenge of any member of the Assembly as she runs against Dave Catalfamo. That race, coupled with the results from 2018 and the election cycles preceding it, raises some important questions. Democratic politics in New York have always been grounded in New York City, but Democrats from rural and Republican parts of the state — from Sen. Franklin Roosevelt, who helped lead the opposition to Tammany from 1911 to 1913, to Sen. Darrel Aubertine, who effectively had veto over power over how far to the left the majority of 2009 and 2010 could go — have usually played an outsized role relative to their numbers. But in an era of significant polarization, is this sort of Democrat an endangered species? And if so, will rural voters lose their voice in Albany if nearly all of their representatives are from a party that seems likely to remain a powerless minority in the years to come? POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney  “AS PART of a sweeping overhaul of the bail system aimed at reducing pretrial incarceration, the state legislature mandated in 2019 that judges setting traditional bail must also offer one of two alternative forms of bail designed to be affordable for low-income defendants. But since the mandate took effect Jan. 1, judges across New York have seldom used one of these bail forms, ‘unsecured bonds,’ and have set the other, [Partially Secured Bond], at dramatically higher rates than traditional bail. By setting PSBs at rates unaffordable for many defendants, criminal justice advocates and public defenders say, judges, who have complete discretion, have in effect nullified a program instituted by the legislature to free more poor people from jail. ‘The battle for bail reform isn’t over, and right now, combatting PSB abuse is the front line,’ said Martin Kaminer, founder of the Emergency Relief Fund, a bail fund that has been working on this issue.” New York Focus’s Akash Mehta  “SANDRA LEE has struck a deal to sell the New Castle home called Lily Pond that she shares with her ex-boyfriend, Gov.

TRUMP\\'S NEW YORK  “THE COPS KNOCKING on the door of an Inwood man’s apartment before dawn weren’t cops at all. They were instead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who duped family members into helping them arrest the clan’s patriarch, now behind bars and facing deportation, his devastated relatives and city officials said Saturday. ‘This is a violation of our law,’ said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, an ex-city police officer, about the duplicitous Thursday bust of Fernando Santos-Rodriguez. ‘You cannot state that you are a municipal police official. You cannot violate the law to carry out the law.’ After getting information from his relatives, ICE agents arrested Santos-Rodriguez, 48, as he arrived at his morning shift as a Harlem restaurant chef.” New York Daily News’ Ellen Moynihan and Larry McShane  — De Blasio sent a letter to ICE demanding their agents stop pretending to be NYPD police, saying he has received numerous reports of agents falsely claiming to be local cops.  “TREASURY SECRETARY Steve Mnuchin has a message for ailing 9/11 city firefighters whose funding his agency has withheld: we’re not giving your money back — go ask NYC. For years, the U.S. Treasury Department has withheld nearly $4 million from the FDNY’s World Trade Center Health Program to satisfy still-unexplained debts that other, unrelated city agencies have with the feds. Mnuchin sent a letter to Mayor De Blasio on Thursday saying that the city should make up the shortfall. And if the city doesn’t pay up, Mnuchin threatened to take other federal healthcare funding meant for New York, and give that to the fire department instead.” New York Daily News’ Michael McAuliff  ... 2020 VISION ...  “THE CANDIDATES FOR Congress in New York City’s only swing district are slugging it out in campaign ads that direct much of their fury at a man who isn’t on the ballot — Mayor Bill de Blasio. ‘Bill de Blasio is the worst mayor in the history of New York City,’ first-term Congress member Max Rose says of his fellow Democrat in a Sept. 9 digital ad. ‘Everybody knows Bill de Blasio is the country’s most radical mayor,’ Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis counters in a Sept. 22 TV ad.

One elected official wants the company fired, while a second is demanding that the city Board of Elections — which awarded Phoenix Graphics a $4.6 million no-bid contract — retrieve the money paid to the vendor.

SOME CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE SABER RATTLING … THE NRCC is giddy with excitement. They have a poll that has Rep. CHERI BUSTOS (D-Ill.), the chair of the DCCC, up just 5 percentage points over ESTHER JOY KING, the Republican running against her, with another 7 percent undecided. BUSTOS is from a TRUMP district -- which was part of her calling card when she ran. Democrats don’t put much stock in the poll, and think BUSTOS is going to wallop KING. BUT … BUSTOS did just go negative on KING, knocking her from being from Chicago and looking to cut health care. The ad  -- THE DCCC RESPONDS: “The rumors are true -- Chairwoman Bustos represents a district that swung 17 points toward Republicans in 2016 to vote for Donald Trump, and her constant focus on the needs of the communities she serves is why she’s continued to win her district handily year after year. What’s unclear is who the NRCC troll factory thinks they’re surprising with this poll when they have much bigger problems to deal with on every front.  “The fact that Cheri Bustos has won big in a Trump district is exactly the reason she is the right person to ensure the 30 Democrats in this caucus who also represent Trump won districts come back in three weeks.”  SCOTUS WATCH -- “Supreme Court allows Trump administration to end census count,” by Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein  -- NPR’s @hansilowang: “The Census Bureau says it will keep accepting online #2020Census responses at http://My2020Census.gov through Oct. 15 until 11:59 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time.” Census statement  BIG READ … NYT’S ASTEAD HERNDON with a ‘Long Run’ story: “What Kamala Harris Learned About Power at Howard”  DAVID SIDERS: “Minnesota shows few signs of flipping — despite Trump's best efforts”: “Donald Trump has fixated on Minnesota since his narrow loss to Hillary Clinton there four years ago. But with less than a month until the election, his prospects there are dimming. Joe Biden’s polling lead remains solid. Even after heavy campaign spending and recent visits to the state by the president and top surrogates, Biden was running ahead of Trump by more than 9 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.  “‘I haven’t heard from anyone on the Republican side who’s to some degree confident,’ said Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party. ‘I think the best you’ll hear from a Republican in Minnesota is they think that the race is close.’ Four years ago, it was close. Trump lost the state by fewer than 45,000 votes, and immediately after the election began signaling his infatuation with Minnesota. It was one of his few offensive opportunities on the 2020 battleground map.  “If he could limit his losses in the Twin Cities and their suburbs and run up turnout in more rural, conservative reaches of the state, Republicans and Democrats alike believed he had a credible chance of winning — something no Republican has done since Richard Nixon in 1972.  “The president has traveled to Northern Minnesota twice in recent weeks in an effort to juice his base in a region culturally distant from the Democratic-heavy cities Minneapolis and St. Paul. Before largely white crowds in Bemidji in mid-September and Duluth two weeks ago, Trump mocked Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American and former refugee who represents a Minneapolis-based district. At both events, he said Biden would ‘turn Minnesota into a refugee camp.’”  IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES -- “Covid crisis colors Wisconsin race,” by Natasha Korecki … “Trump campaign stalls in Pennsylvania,” by Holly Otterbein … “Democrats dominate early voting in Florida,” by Marc Caputo  TRUMP’S WEDNESDAY -- The president will deliver remarks to the Economic Clubs of New York, Florida, Washington, Chicago, Florida and Sheboygan in the Rose Garden at 11 a.m. He will leave the White House at 4:05 p.m. for Des Moines.

All three Rust Belt states that Trump improbably won in 2016 — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — are problematic for the president this year. But Michigan is where things look bleakest.  “His support has diminished among the white working-class. Black turnout appears certain to rebound after a dismal showing in 2016. New laws that allow for early voting and no-excuse absentee balloting are expected to push voter participation to historic levels, with Democrats the expected beneficiary of low-propensity Michiganders flooding the ballot box. But the simplest explanation for the president’s trouble here is that he’s continuing to hemorrhage support from white, college-educated women in the suburbs of Detroit.  “It’s hard to overstate just how badly Trump is performing with this crucial demographic. Over the past several weeks, a raft of internal polls have produced numbers that political professionals here are struggling to comprehend. In Oakland County, the second-biggest voting area in the state, Gongwer reported that Democratic polling shows Biden leading Trump by 27 points; Republicans pushed back with a survey showing Trump down only 18 points. (For reference, Trump lost Oakland County by 8 points in 2016.)”  ACROSS THE POND -- “Netherlands to return to ‘partial lockdown’ amid rising coronavirus cases,” by Eline Schaart: “The Dutch government ordered a partial lockdown Tuesday and changed tack on masks by mandating them in public spaces in a bid to control one of the worst coronavirus infection rates in the EU.  “‘We are going to a partial lockdown,’ Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said during a press conference. ‘That hurts, but it's the only way.’  “The Netherlands had long held out on mandating masks in public, unlike many of its European neighbors, but will now require them in places such as stores and museums.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Tuesday that third-quarter profit rose 4% from a year ago, beating Wall Street estimates. Citigroup Inc., too, delivered better-than-expected results.  “Taken together, the two banks’ third-quarter results show that businesses and consumers held up surprisingly well in the months since the pandemic plunged the U.S. into recession. But the leaders of both banks warned that the economy isn’t out of the woods. The results were boosted because the banks didn’t have to put aside as much money to cover future loan losses. But executives said they haven’t yet changed their views that significant losses are looming in the future.  “They continue to hold large reserves for potential losses and predicted that next year unemployment would remain high and more customers could start defaulting on their loans. JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon warned that without more public assistance for the economy, it could grow worse.” WSJ  MEDIAWATCH -- The NYT is shuttering its At War blog this week.
